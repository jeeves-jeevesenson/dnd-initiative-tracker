description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss. Their corruption and violence delighted
  the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been
  the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains. Rising above other gnolls with their
  viciousness and physical prowess, gnoll pack lords terrorize weaker gnolls into their service. These brutes drive other
  gnolls to acts of great violence, then claim the best of their servants' spoils.
