description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss.
  Their corruption and violence delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged
  their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been
  the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains.  Rising
  above other gnolls with their viciousness and physical prowess, gnoll pack lords
  terrorize weaker gnolls into their service. These brutes drive other gnolls to acts
  of great violence, then claim the best of their servants' spoils.
