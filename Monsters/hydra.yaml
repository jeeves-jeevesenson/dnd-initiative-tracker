traits:
- name: Hold Breath
  desc: The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- name: Multiple Heads
  desc: The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being
    {@condition blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition stunned}, and
    knocked {@condition unconscious}. Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies.
    If all its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since
    its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown
    in this way.
- name: Reactive Heads
  desc: For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
- name: Wakeful
