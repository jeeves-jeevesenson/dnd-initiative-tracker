description: Most gorgons are iron bulls wreathed in clouds of petrifying gas. Their metal plates vary in sheen
  and color, from sleek silver to pitted black. The oldest gorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely impedes
  their abilities. These gorgons' stomping grounds are littered with the shattered remains of petrified foes. Many
  gorgons outlive their creators by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations have natural origins and
  territories. Most such gorgons continue to follow age-old commands, guarding sites long fallen to ruin.
