description: Tirelessly destructive, quasits sow discord through nasty pranks, sabotage,
  and ambushes. These tiny demons use chaos and violence to terrorize others. By shape-shifting
  into harmless but ill-omened creatures or by turning invisible, quasits sneak into
  places where they spy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight
  in hiding in dark places and—when least expected—bursting forth to slash foes with
  their poisoned claws. Quasits are usually overlooked and underestimated by other
  demons. This drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths
  to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless chaos, and they might
  find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists and magic-users.
