description: Tirelessly destructive, quasits sow discord through nasty pranks, sabotage, and ambushes. These tiny demons use
  chaos and violence to terrorize others. By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened creatures or by turning invisible,
  quasits sneak into places where they spy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding in dark
  places and—when least expected—bursting forth to slash foes with their poisoned claws. Quasits are usually overlooked and
  underestimated by other demons. This drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths to the Material
  Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless chaos, and they might find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists and magic-users.

  desc: The quasit can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a bat (speed 10 feet fly 40 ft.), a centipede
    (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each
