description: In their natural forms, mimics are little more than roaming stomachs, their blobby bodies covered with alien
  eyes and teeth. They can alter their color, texture, and dimensions to duplicate inanimate objects of their approximate
  size. Mimics use their disguises as both camouflage and bait. Once victims draw close, mimics strike, lashing out with their
  sticky pseudopods and toothy mouths. After consuming victims, mimics usually relocate, change form, and await their next
  meal.
