description: Revenants possess the bodies they had in life, using them to hunt down their killers. If their bodies are destroyed,
  they take control of new bodies that gradually change to resemble the revenants' original forms.
habitat: Forest, Swamp, Urban
treasure: Any
traits:
- name: Regeneration
  desc: The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this trait
    doesn't function at the start of the revenant's next turn. The revenant's body is destroyed only if it starts its turn
    with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
- name: Rejuvenation
  desc: When the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another humanoid
    corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a {@spell wish} spell
    can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.
- name: Turn Immunity
  desc: The revenant is immune to effects that turn undead.
- name: Vengeful Tracker
  desc: The revenant knows the distance to and direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even if the creature
    and the revenant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies, the revenant
    knows.
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: The revenant makes two fist attacks.
- name: Fist
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 ({@damage 2d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target
    is a creature against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14 ({@damage 4d6}) bludgeoning
    damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape {@dc 14}) provided the target is Large
    or smaller.'
- name: Vengeful Glare
  desc: The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target
    must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is {@condition paralyzed} until the revenant deals
    damage to it, or until the end of the revenant's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is {@condition frightened}
    of the revenant for 1 minute. The {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
    turns, with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success.
