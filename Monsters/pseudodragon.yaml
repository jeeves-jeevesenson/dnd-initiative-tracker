description: Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow.
  There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these
  lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these
  hoards fiercely. Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have
  scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins. Many magic-users
  attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures' intellect and resistance
  to magic make them excellent companions, and they're considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles. Many
  pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply
  them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don't properly pamper their pseudodragon familiars might be abandoned
  without warning.
