- name: Swallow
  desc: The frog swallows a Small or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't Grappled
    but has the Blinded and Restrained conditions, and it has Total Cover against attacks and other effects outside
    the frog. While swallowing the target, the frog can't use Bite, and if the frog dies, the swallowed target is
    no longer Restrained and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the Prone condition.
    At the end of the frog's next turn, the swallowed target takes 5 (2d4) Acid damage. If that damage doesn't kill
    it, the frog disgorges it, causing it to exit Prone.
