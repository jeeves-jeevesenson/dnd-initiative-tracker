- name: Multiattack
  desc: 'The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.'
- name: Claws
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 2d4 + 1}) slashing damage.'
- name: Club
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d4 + 1}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Luring Song
  desc: The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must
    succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus
    action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is {@condition
    incapacitated}. While {@condition charmed} by the harpy, a target is {@condition incapacitated} and ignores the songs
    of other harpies. If the {@condition charmed} target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on
    its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging
    terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can repeat the
    saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw
    is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24
    hours.
