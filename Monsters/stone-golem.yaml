description: Stone golems take varied forms, such as weathered carvings of ancient deities, lifelike sculptures of heroes,
  or any other shape their makers imagine. No matter their design or the rock from which they're crafted, these golems are
  strengthened by the magic that animates them, allowing them to follow their creators' orders for centuries. Stone golems
  are typically created to protect places of significance to a group, such as a monument to an important event, a leader's
  tomb, or a faith's sanctuary.

traits:
- name: Immutable Form

- name: Slam
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Slow {@recharge 5}
  desc: The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving
    throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more
    than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both.
    These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
    on itself on a success.
