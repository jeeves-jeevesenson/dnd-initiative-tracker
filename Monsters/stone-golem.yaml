description: Stone golems take varied forms, such as weathered carvings of ancient deities, lifelike sculptures
  of heroes, or any other shape their makers imagine. No matter their design or the rock from which they're crafted,
  these golems are strengthened by the magic that animates them, allowing them to follow their creators' orders
  for centuries. Stone golems are typically created to protect places of significance to a group, such as a monument
  to an important event, a leader's tomb, or a faith's sanctuary.
