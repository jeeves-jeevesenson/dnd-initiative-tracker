description: Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets and strike magical
  bargains, altering fate to indulge their fickle whims. These timeless schemers pursue
  the secrets of the multiverse and work strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable
  goals. Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and greedy, with bizarre fascinations
  and affectations. Nevertheless, they often make deals to further their plots. These
  hags are fonts of secret knowledge, particularly lore regarding forbidden magic
  and multiversal secrets. They might share their knowledge, but their secrets always
  have a price. In trade for their secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar errands,
  valuable magic items, or preternatural currency, like one's memories, a year of
  one's life, or the ability to cry. Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to
  fight, they unleash dangerous magic, such as spectral claws, arcing lightning, and
  mind-bending spells. An arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding the spellcasters'
  incantations and forcing the spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean.
  Even if an arch-hag is brought low, its preparations allow it to magically slip
  away and begin plotting its revenge. Every arch-hag has a unique weakness tied to
  a fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something that embodies the antithesis
  of the hag's magic. A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability secret.
  Although an arch-hag isn't physically harmed by its weakness, it can be destroyed
  only while its weakness is nearby.
