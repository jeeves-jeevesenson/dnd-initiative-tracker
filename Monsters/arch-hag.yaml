description: Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets and strike magical bargains, altering fate to indulge their
  fickle whims. These timeless schemers pursue the secrets of the multiverse and work strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable
  goals. Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and greedy, with bizarre fascinations and affectations. Nevertheless,
  they often make deals to further their plots. These hags are fonts of secret knowledge, particularly lore regarding forbidden
  magic and multiversal secrets. They might share their knowledge, but their secrets always have a price. In trade for their
  secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar errands, valuable magic items, or preternatural currency, like one's memories,
  a year of one's life, or the ability to cry. Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to fight, they unleash dangerous
  magic, such as spectral claws, arcing lightning, and mind-bending spells. An arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding
  the spellcasters' incantations and forcing the spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean. Even if an arch-hag is
  brought low, its preparations allow it to magically slip away and begin plotting its revenge. Every arch-hag has a unique
  weakness tied to a fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something that embodies the antithesis of the hag's magic.
  A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability secret. Although an arch-hag isn't physically harmed by its weakness,
  it can be destroyed only while its weakness is nearby.
