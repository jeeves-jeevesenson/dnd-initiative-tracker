description: Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world as a place of endless wonder and possibility.
  These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least,
  the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their friends, these dragons favor using
  their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their
  deadly acid breath. Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those
  that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning,
  no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more
  important than masterpieces or magical relics.

    end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the
    effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- name: Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}
  desc: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons. The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.
    Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 ({@damage 12d8}) acid damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area
    must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is
    halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus
    action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
