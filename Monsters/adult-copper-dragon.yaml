description: Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world as a place of endless wonder
  and possibility. These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve
  the lives—or, at least, the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their
  friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases
  of extreme peril or emotion do they use their deadly acid breath. Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid
  picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts,
  though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully
  given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.
