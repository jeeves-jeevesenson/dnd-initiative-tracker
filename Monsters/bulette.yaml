    saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked {@condition prone} and take 14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage plus
    14 ({@damage 3d6 + 4}) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked {@condition
    prone}, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied
    space is within range, the creature instead falls {@condition prone} in the bulette's space.
