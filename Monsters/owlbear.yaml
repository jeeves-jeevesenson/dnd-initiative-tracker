description: Created long ago by misguided mages, owlbears combine keen avian eyes,
  thick feathers, and a tearing beak with a mighty bearlike frame. Despite their magical
  origins, owlbears have propagated and spread to wildernesses across the multiverse.
  Owlbears dwell in distinctive dens.  Owlbears are tenacious hunters that might track
  prey over miles and rarely give up their hunts.
