description: Inheritors of divine might, empyreans are idealized, human-shaped beings
  of godly power. These beings might have relationships with their creators akin to
  those of parents and their children, royalty and their servants, inventors and their
  creations, or other bonds. Empyreans' existences are fundamentally influenced by
  their patrons and their connection to the heavenly deities of the Upper Planes or
  the fiendish deities of the Lower Planes. Nevertheless, empyreans have free will.
  Celestial empyreans are typically noble beings who quest to prove themselves worthy
  of their divine pedigree. Many work in the service of their parents or support those
  gods' causes and champions. Fiendish empyreans are usually dreadful, self-serving
  villains who seek to claim their parents' power. Some forge unholy armies or rule
  over hidden realms in mockery of true gods, while others might seek to escape their
  accursed families.
