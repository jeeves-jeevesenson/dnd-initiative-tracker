description: Kuo-toa loot ruins and raid communities near their dwellings in the Underdark.
  Their shields are coated in sticky slime, which they use to disarm their foes, and
  they employ slimy nets to entrap victims. They usually strive to take their enemies
  alive and drag captives to their hidden lairs.  Most kuo-toa follow the orders of
  their more powerful leaders out of a combination of faith and fear. In rare cases,

  might know much about the Underdark, but they live in fear of the strange gods they
  forsook.
