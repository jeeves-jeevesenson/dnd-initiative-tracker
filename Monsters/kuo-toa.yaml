description: Kuo-toa loot ruins and raid communities near their dwellings in the Underdark. Their shields are coated
  in sticky slime, which they use to disarm their foes, and they employ slimy nets to entrap victims. They usually
  strive to take their enemies alive and drag captives to their hidden lairs. Most kuo-toa follow the orders of
  their more powerful leaders out of a combination of faith and fear. In rare cases, a kuo-toa might abandon its
  community to live as a hermit or wanderer. Such kuo-toa might know much about the Underdark, but they live in
  fear of the strange gods they forsook.
