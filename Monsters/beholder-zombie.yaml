description: Zombies animated from the corpses of beholders retain some use of those monsters' magical eyestalks. These hovering
  corpses rely on their magic to destroy impediments and paralyze foes, allowing them to savage foes with their rotting maws.
  Magic-using beholders typically raise these abominations from the corpses of defeated rivals.
habitat: Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban
traits:
- name: Undead Fortitude
  desc: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage
    taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
actions:
- name: Bite
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 4d6}) piercing damage.'
- name: Eye Ray
  desc: The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing a target that it can see within 60 feet of it. The targeted creature
    must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target can repeat
    the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The targeted creature must
    succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving
    throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The targeted creature must make a {@dc
    14} Constitution saving throw, taking 36 ({@damage 8d8}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
    successful one. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw or take 45 ({@damage
    10d8}) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If
    the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving
    throw. If the target is a Huge or larger nonmagical object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot
    cube of it.
