description: Zombies animated from the corpses of beholders retain some use of those
  monsters' magical eyestalks. These hovering corpses rely on their magic to destroy
  impediments and paralyze foes, allowing them to savage foes with their rotting maws.
  Magic-using beholders typically raise these abominations from the corpses of defeated
  rivals.
