description: Green hags work bitter magic to foul all that is beautiful and pure. Whether alone or in covens of
  other hags, these ancient witches call on eerie forces, spreading corruption and plotting doom for those who earn
  their ire. Green hags are adept deceivers, and they use illusions to cloak themselves in unassuming forms, hoping
  to tempt innocents into peril. These hags often spirit their victims back to surreal lairs where they hold captives
  prisoner or cook them into monstrous meals. Green hags frequently know strange magic or forgotten secrets, such
  as the weaknesses of villains, the locations of lost treasures, or the ways to break curses. They might trade
  such knowledge for rare magic or symbolic treasures.
