description: Green hags work bitter magic to foul all that is beautiful and pure. Whether alone or in covens of other hags,
  these ancient witches call on eerie forces, spreading corruption and plotting doom for those who earn their ire. Green hags
  are adept deceivers, and they use illusions to cloak themselves in unassuming forms, hoping to tempt innocents into peril.
  These hags often spirit their victims back to surreal lairs where they hold captives prisoner or cook them into monstrous
  meals. Green hags frequently know strange magic or forgotten secrets, such as the weaknesses of villains, the locations
  of lost treasures, or the ways to break curses. They might trade such knowledge for rare magic or symbolic treasures.
habitat: Forest, Hill, Swamp
treasure: Arcana
traits:
- name: Amphibious
  desc: The hag can breathe air and water.
- name: Mimicry
  desc: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations
    with a successful {@dc 14} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.
actions:
- name: Claws
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.'
- name: Illusory Appearance
  desc: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another
    creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she
    dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to
    have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually
    inspect the illusion and succeed on a {@dc 20} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the hag is
    disguised.
- name: Invisible Passage
  desc: The hag magically turns {@condition invisible} until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her {@status concentration}
    ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). While {@condition invisible}, she leaves no physical evidence
    of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with
    her.
