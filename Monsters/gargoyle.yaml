description: Gargoyles are sculptures inhabited by elemental spirits. Wings and magic allow their heavy stone bodies
  to fly, and they often perch where they can blend in amid ornate architecture, rock formations, or mundane statues.
  Gargoyles usually serve the magic-users who conjured them into their bodies, but if left to their own devices,
  they might play cruel pranks and steal treasures to hoard in lofty lairs.
