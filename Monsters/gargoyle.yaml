description: Gargoyles are sculptures inhabited by elemental spirits. Wings and magic
  allow their heavy stone bodies to fly, and they often perch where they can blend
  in amid ornate architecture, rock formations, or mundane statues. Gargoyles usually
  serve the magic-users who conjured them into their bodies, but if left to their
  own devices, they might play cruel pranks and steal treasures to hoard in lofty
  lairs.
