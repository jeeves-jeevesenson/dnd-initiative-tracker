- name: Whirlwind {@recharge 4}
  desc: Each creature in the elemental's space must make a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15
    ({@damage 3d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked
    {@condition prone}. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6})
    bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed
    on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked {@condition prone}. If the saving throw is
    successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked {@condition prone}.
