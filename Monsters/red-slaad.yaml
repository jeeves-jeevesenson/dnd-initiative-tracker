description: Red slaadi amass in vast throngs in Limbo. There they wrestle and croak-sing as they endlessly dismantle and
  rebuild islands of drifting planar matter. When they encounter non-slaadi, red slaadi seek to play with, telepathically
  converse with, or devour the other creatures. These whims change from moment to moment. Red slaadi instinctively avoid harming
  those bearing slaadi eggs, which red slaadi implant using their claws, or other slaad curses.

actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: 'The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.'
- name: Bite
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 2d4 + 3}) piercing damage.'
- name: Claw
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage. If the target is a
    humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a minuscule slaad egg.
    A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity,
    gestates, and forms a {@creature slaad tadpole}. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell,
    its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole
    chews its way through vital organs and out of the host''s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease
    is cured before the tadpole''s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.'
