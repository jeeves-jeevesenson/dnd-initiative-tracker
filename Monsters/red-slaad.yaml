description: Red slaadi amass in vast throngs in Limbo. There they wrestle and croak-sing as they endlessly dismantle
  and rebuild islands of drifting planar matter. When they encounter non-slaadi, red slaadi seek to play with, telepathically
  converse with, or devour the other creatures. These whims change from moment to moment. Red slaadi instinctively
  avoid harming those bearing slaadi eggs, which red slaadi implant using their claws, or other slaad curses.
