description: Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth, these
  dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule over what remains. Black dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns
  and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of
  magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and
  leaving nature with festering wounds. Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more
  sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—particularly if they were responsible for it being lost.
