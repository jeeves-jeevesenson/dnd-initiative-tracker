description: Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth,
  these dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule over what remains. Black dragons are terrifying creatures
  with curved horns and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps,
  crumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding
  the features from ancient statues and leaving nature with festering wounds. Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols
  of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—particularly
  if they were responsible for it being lost.
