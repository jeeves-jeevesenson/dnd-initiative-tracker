description: Created long ago by misguided mages, owlbears combine keen avian eyes, thick feathers, and a tearing
  beak with a mighty bearlike frame. Despite their magical origins, owlbears have propagated and spread to wildernesses
  across the multiverse. Owlbears dwell in distinctive dens. Ancient forests and Feywild demesnes steeped in magic
  can give rise to particularly large and vicious owlbears. These primeval specimens can fly—albeit poorly—and emit
  thunderous screeches that can rattle foes and even tear them asunder.
habitat: Forest
