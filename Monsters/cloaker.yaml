traits:
- name: Damage Transfer
  desc: While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature
    takes the other half.
- name: False Appearance
  desc: While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.
- name: Light Sensitivity
  desc: While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely
    on sight.
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: 'The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.'
- name: Bite
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage, and if the target
    is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches
    to the target''s head, and the target is {@condition blinded} and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While
    attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can
    detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the
    cloaker by succeeding on a {@dc 16} Strength check.'
- name: Tail
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) slashing damage.'
- name: Moan
  desc: Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a
    {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's
    saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.
- name: Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
  desc: The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move
    with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If
    the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear. Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with
    an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the
    cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses
    other than sight. A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a
    duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.
