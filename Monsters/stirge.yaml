    to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn''t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge''s turns, the target
    loses 5 ({@dice 1d4 + 3}) hit points due to blood loss. The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.

    can use its action to detach the stirge.'
