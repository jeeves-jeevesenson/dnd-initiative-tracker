description: Night hags seek mortals to torment and turn to evil. By day, night hags
  use supernatural deceptions to plague their victims, shape-shifting to pose as other
  creatures and make their targets believe the world has turned against them. By night,
  these hags reinforce their tortures with terrifying dreams. Once they force their
  targets to desperate limits, night hags claim their victims' tormented spirits,
  capturing them in sinister traps called soul bags. The hags then slip between planes
  of existence to barter stolen souls to vile magic-users and fiendish entities. Night
  hags maintain networks of nefarious customers and collect rumors from across the
  Lower Planes. These hags might part with their secrets in exchange for magic items
  and other wicked prices.

traits:
- name: Coven Magic
  desc: 'While within 30 feet of at least two hag allies, the hag can cast one of
    the following spells, requiring no Material components, using the spell''s normal
    casting time, and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC
    14): Augury, Find Familiar, Identify, Locate Object, Scrying, or Unseen Servant.
    The hag must finish a Long Rest before using this trait to cast that spell again.'

- name: Soul Bag
  desc: The hag has a soul bag. While holding or carrying the bag, the hag can use
    its Nightmare Haunting action. The bag has AC 15, HP 20, and Resistance to all
    damage. The bag turns to dust if reduced to 0 Hit Points. If the bag is destroyed,

- name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day; Requires Soul Bag)
  desc: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag casts Dream, using the same spellcasting
    ability as Spellcasting. Only the hag can serve as the spell's messenger, and
    the target must be a creature the hag can see on the Material Plane. The spell
    fails and is wasted if the target is under the effect of the Protection from Evil
    and Good spell or within a Magic Circle spell. If the target takes damage from
    the Dream spell, the target's Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to
    that damage. If the spell kills the target, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul
    bag, and the target can't be raised from the dead until its soul is released.

    and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):'
