description: Night hags seek mortals to torment and turn to evil. By day, night hags use supernatural deceptions to plague
  their victims, shape-shifting to pose as other creatures and make their targets believe the world has turned against them.
  By night, these hags reinforce their tortures with terrifying dreams. Once they force their targets to desperate limits,
  night hags claim their victims' tormented spirits, capturing them in sinister traps called soul bags. The hags then slip
  between planes of existence to barter stolen souls to vile magic-users and fiendish entities. Night hags maintain networks
  of nefarious customers and collect rumors from across the Lower Planes. These hags might part with their secrets in exchange
  for magic items and other wicked prices.
habitat: Planar (Lower Planes)
treasure: Arcana
traits:
- name: Magic Resistance
  desc: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- name: Night Hag Items
  desc: 'A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself. If either object is lost, the night
    hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort. Heartstone: This lustrous black
    gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease.
    Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days. Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag''s Nightmare Haunting,
    the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time,
    and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice
    (whose flesh is used to make the bag).'
actions:
- name: Claws (Hag Form Only)
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) slashing damage.'
- name: Change Shape
  desc: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are
    the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she
    dies.
- name: Etherealness
  desc: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a
    heartstone in her possession.
- name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)
  desc: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A {@spell protection
    from evil and good} spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists,
    the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest,
    and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 ({@dice 1d10}). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0,
    the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's
    hit point maximum lasts until removed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.
