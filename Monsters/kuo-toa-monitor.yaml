description: Kuo-toa monitors control the day-to-day life of weaker kuo-toa, directing
  their work and worship. They also train beasts or monsters in the kuo-toa's service—such
  as chuuls or giant crabs—and command them in battle. Archpriests bless monitors
  with the power to control their underlings and to subdue foes with electricity channeled
  through their bizarre whips.
