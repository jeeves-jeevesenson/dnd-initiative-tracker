description: Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness and ruin. They delight in wreckage—the louder, the
  more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better. Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting
  fires and tormenting livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots. Goblins obey those who accomplish the
  wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users, or those capable of making
  the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their
  destructiveness toward banditry, sabotage, or war. Goblin hexers use flashy and disruptive magic. Many goblin
  hexers are theatrical, dressing and behaving in exaggerated mimicry of archmages.
