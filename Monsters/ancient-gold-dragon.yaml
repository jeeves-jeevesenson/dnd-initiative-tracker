description: Gold dragons work to make the world a better place. The most powerful of the metallic dragons, these awe-inspiring
  dragons strive to protect that which is good and bend fate toward a brighter future. Their kind dispositions don't prevent
  gold dragons from engaging in combat when necessary, though, and they exhale brilliant flames and weakening magic to rout
  their foes. Gold dragons favor grasslands and pristine forests, frequently dwelling near awe-inspiring natural wonders or
  guarding monuments from ancient civilizations. In their lairs, gold dragons hoard coins and gems, but they frequently put
  their treasure to use in pursuit of greater goals. They often use their riches to buy rare lore books, pay informants, or
  patronize idealistic adventurers.
