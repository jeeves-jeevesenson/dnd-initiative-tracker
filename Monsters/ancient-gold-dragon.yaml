description: Gold dragons work to make the world a better place. The most powerful
  of the metallic dragons, these awe-inspiring dragons strive to protect that which
  is good and bend fate toward a brighter future. Their kind dispositions don't prevent
  gold dragons from engaging in combat when necessary, though, and they exhale brilliant
  flames and weakening magic to rout their foes. Gold dragons favor grasslands and
  pristine forests, frequently dwelling near awe-inspiring natural wonders or guarding
  monuments from ancient civilizations. In their lairs, gold dragons hoard coins and
  gems, but they frequently put their treasure to use in pursuit of greater goals.
  They often use their riches to buy rare lore books, pay informants, or patronize
  idealistic adventurers.
