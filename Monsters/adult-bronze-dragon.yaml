description: Where bronze dragons dwell, wonders flourish. Imaginative yet mindful,
  these metallic dragons work toward greatness and help others achieve all they can.
  They strive to preserve innovations, from the works of past civilizations to new
  discoveries, and they share such works widely. When dealing with shorter-lived beings,
  bronze dragons prefer to win them over through conversation and cultivation, but
  they don't shy from battle when villains keep others from achieving their potential.
  Bronze dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities of the sea, and they often
  make their lairs in places of natural beauty or communities they wish to preserve.
  Within their dwellings, bronze dragons hoard things they believe will be useful
  one day. They salvage treasure lost to the sea, reclaiming wealth or sunken ships.
