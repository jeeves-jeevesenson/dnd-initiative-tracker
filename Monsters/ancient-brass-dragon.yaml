description: Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories. Although these metallic dragons
  favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they've learned,
  and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical
  sleep and searing them with flame. Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and
  they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms,
  disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others' stories. Brass
  dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a nostalgic
  memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and the crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty
  could occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon's hoard.

- name: Frightful Presence
  desc: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc
    18} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
    end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the
    effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- name: Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}
  desc: 'The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons: The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide.
    Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 ({@damage 16d6}) fire damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that
    area must succeed on a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw or fall {@condition unconscious} for 10 minutes. This effect
    ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.'
- name: Change Shape
  desc: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back
    into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne
    by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability
    to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
    this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features
    or legendary actions of that form.

    to half its flying speed.
