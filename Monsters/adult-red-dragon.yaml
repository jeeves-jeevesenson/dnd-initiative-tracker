description: Red dragons take whatever they desire and burn to ash anything that stands
  in their way. These chromatic dragons endlessly desire more—more magic, territory,
  treasure, or whatever else inflames their cruel ambitions. Red dragons make their
  lairs amid perilous cliffs and volcanoes. Within, they amass and fiercely protect
  hoards of treasure, and many have perfect recall of the hoards' contents and the
  locations of all they've collected. Should anything go missing, red dragons fly
  into rages. They don't rest until their treasures are returned and the thieves have
  burned. Red dragons believe themselves to be the greatest of all dragons and, by
  extension, the greatest of all creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are
  their right—treasures can find no more honored place than in their hoards, and other
  creatures are privileged to serve them.
