description: A demilich is a skull harboring the remnants of a lich's wicked essence. If the burden of immortality
  overwhelms a lich, its consciousness turns inward as its body rots away. But if its remains are disturbed, a demilich
  rises. Demiliches usually appear as skulls adorned with gems or arcane sigils.
