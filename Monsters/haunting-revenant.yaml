description: Haunting revenants possess ruins and forsaken places connected with their deaths—such as abandoned
  buildings, wrecked ships, or junk heaps. These revenants lurk in plain sight, waiting for their foes to near,
  then trap their victims within their massive bodies. Those inside a revenant might be battered by animate furnishings
  or more unsettling manifestations of the revenant's hatred. The places haunting revenants lurk swiftly gain infamous
  reputations.
habitat: Forest, Swamp, Urban
treasure: Any
traits:
- name: Haunted Zone
  desc: 'Constitution Saving Throw : DC 17, any creature that casts a spell while inside the revenant''s space.
    Failure : The spell fails and is wasted.'
- name: Undead Restoration
  desc: If the revenant dies, it revives 24 hours later unless Dispel Evil and Good is cast on its remains. If it
    revives, it animates another Gargantuan object or structure elsewhere on the same plane of existence; it now
    looks different but uses the same stat block and returns with all its Hit Points.
actions:

  desc: The revenant makes two Object Slam attacks and uses Invitation.
- name: Object Slam
  desc: 'Melee or Ranged Attack Roll : +9 (with Advantage if the target is inside the revenant''s space), reach
    10 ft. or range 30/90 ft. Hit : 27 (5d8+ 5) Bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Invitation
  desc: 'Charisma Saving Throw : DC 17, each creature in a 60-foot Cone. Failure : The target is teleported inside
    the revenant''s space and swallowed. A swallowed creature has Total Cover against attacks and other effects
    outside the revenant. While the revenant has Hit Points, a swallowed creature can leave the revenant''s space
    only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the Plane Shift spell.'
