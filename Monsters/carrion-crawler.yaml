description: Ravenous corpse eaters, carrion crawlers gravitate toward places of slaughter and decay. In such charnel
  environs, they feast on the dead with no qualms about their meals' origins or freshness. Carrion crawlers have
  segmented bodies like gigantic cutworms. From beneath their multipart maws protrude eight thin, lashing tentacles.
  Creatures struck by these tentacles risk being paralyzed and consumed. Carrion crawlers scour sewers, battlefields,
  necropolises, and fetid wildernesses for corpses, clinging to ceilings to ambush smaller prey and to avoid competing
  hunters. They're drawn to light and the scent of blood, recognizing them as signs of food. These scavengers avoid
  ingesting inorganic material. Crypts with funeral armors sucked clean of their corpses and eerily pristine catacombs
  are signs of infestation by carrion crawlers.
