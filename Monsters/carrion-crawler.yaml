description: Ravenous corpse eaters, carrion crawlers gravitate toward places of slaughter and decay. In such charnel environs,
  they feast on the dead with no qualms about their meals' origins or freshness. Carrion crawlers have segmented bodies like
  gigantic cutworms. From beneath their multipart maws protrude eight thin, lashing tentacles. Creatures struck by these tentacles
  risk being paralyzed and consumed. Carrion crawlers scour sewers, battlefields, necropolises, and fetid wildernesses for
  corpses, clinging to ceilings to ambush smaller prey and to avoid competing hunters. They're drawn to light and the scent
  of blood, recognizing them as signs of food. These scavengers avoid ingesting inorganic material. Crypts with funeral armors
  sucked clean of their corpses and eerily pristine catacombs are signs of infestation by carrion crawlers.
