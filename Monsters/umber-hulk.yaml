description: ''
habitat: Underdark
traits:
- name: Confusing Gaze
  desc: When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the umber hulk and is able to see the umber hulk's eyes, the umber
    hulk can magically force it to make a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw, unless the umber hulk is {@condition incapacitated}.
    On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a {@dice d8} to
    determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action
    but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack against a random
    creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach. Unless {@status surprised}, a creature can avert its eyes
    to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the umber hulk until the start
    of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the umber hulk in the meantime, it must immediately
    make the save.
