description: Quivering masses of acidic goo, gelatinous cubes wobble through narrow caverns and dungeons, engulfing anything
  in their paths. These Oozes are naturally transparent, making them difficult to see while they're stationary. Creatures
  and objects that become stuck within these slimes are gradually dissolved. Undigested detritus sometimes floats within a
  gelatinous cube, hinting at its past meals.
habitat: Underdark
treasure: Any
traits:
- name: Ooze Cube
  desc: The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected
    to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have {@quickref
    Cover||3||total cover}. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the
    cube. Doing so requires a successful {@dc 12} Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 ({@damage 3d6})
    acid damage. The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.
- name: Transparent
  desc: Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot a
    cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is
    {@status surprised} by the cube.
actions:
- name: Pseudopod
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d6}) acid damage.'
- name: Engulf
  desc: The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube
    enters a creature's space, the creature must make a {@dc 12} Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature
    can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences
    of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 ({@damage
    3d6}) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is {@condition restrained}, and takes 21 ({@damage
    6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.
    An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a {@dc 12} Strength check. On a success, the creature
    escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.
