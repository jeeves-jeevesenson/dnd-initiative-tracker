description: Quivering masses of acidic goo, gelatinous cubes wobble through narrow caverns and dungeons, engulfing
  anything in their paths. These Oozes are naturally transparent, making them difficult to see while they're stationary.
  Creatures and objects that become stuck within these slimes are gradually dissolved. Undigested detritus sometimes
  floats within a gelatinous cube, hinting at its past meals.
habitat: Underdark
treasure: Any
traits:
- name: Ooze Cube
  desc: The cube fills its entire space and is transparent. Other creatures can enter that space, but a creature
    that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has Disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the
    cube have Total Cover, and the cube can hold one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures inside
    itself at a time. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can pull a creature or an object out of
    the cube by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and the puller takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage.
- name: Transparent
  desc: Even when the cube is in plain sight, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice
    the cube if the creature hasn't witnessed the cube move or otherwise act.
actions:
- name: Pseudopod
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll : +4, reach 5 ft. Hit : 12 (3d6 + 2) Acid damage.'
- name: Engulf
  desc: 'The cube moves up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move through the spaces
    of Large or smaller creatures if it has room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube trait). Dexterity
    Saving Throw : DC 12, each creature whose space the cube enters for the first time during this move. Failure
    : 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can''t cast spells with
    a Verbal component, has the Restrained condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start of each of the
    cube''s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target can try to escape
    by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target escapes and
    enters the nearest unoccupied space. Success : Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied space within
    5 feet of the cube. If there is no unoccupied space, the target fails the save instead.'
