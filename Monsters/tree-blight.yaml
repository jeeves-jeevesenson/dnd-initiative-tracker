description: Tree blights look like ancient, dead trees with gnarled limbs and splintered
  hollows. Imbued with bloodlust, these blights feed on the living. Evidence of their
  past meals is often tangled amid their branches and roots. Tree blights cooperate
  with other blights, but they attack other tree-shaped beings they encounter, such
  as awakened trees and treants.
habitat: Forest
