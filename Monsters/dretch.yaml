  desc: A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area
    is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that
    area must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the start of its next turn.
    While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both,
    and can't take reactions.
