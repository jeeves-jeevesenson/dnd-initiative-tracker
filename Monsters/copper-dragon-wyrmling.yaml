description: Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world
  as a place of endless wonder and possibility. These gregarious dragons are fonts
  of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least,
  the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or
  their friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks
  to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their
  deadly acid breath. Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills
  and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons
  collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no
  matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings
  or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.
