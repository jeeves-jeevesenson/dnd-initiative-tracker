description: Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness and ruin. They delight
  in wreckage—the louder, the more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better.
  Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting fires and tormenting
  livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots. Goblins obey those who accomplish
  the wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users,
  or those capable of making the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids
  might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their destructiveness toward
  banditry, sabotage, or war.  Goblin minions enjoy participating in the disruptive
  schemes of clever leaders but are quick to flee when confronted by their comeuppance.
