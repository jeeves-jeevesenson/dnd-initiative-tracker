description: Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to their whims.
  Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent
  on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal. Hobgoblins often subjugate animals,
  monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons,
  warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should
  hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars
  and planes of existence beyond. Hobgoblin warriors might hunt and raid alone or with trained mastiffs, worgs, goblin gangs,
  or other allies. They employ simple tactics and exploit every advantage their allies provide. They willingly sacrifice companions
  in their pursuit of victory.
