- name: Incorporeal Movement

- name: Etherealness
  desc: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while
    it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
- name: Horrifying Visage
  desc: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw
    or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 × 10} years.
    A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition frightened}
    condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune
    to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a {@spell greater restoration}
    spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
- name: Possession {@recharge}
  desc: One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Charisma saving throw or be possessed
    by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body. The
    ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell,
    or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity
    to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't
    gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to
    0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the {@spell
    dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
    body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession
    ends.
