description: Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords to reclusive witches. They study
  mystical secrets and possess insight into monsters, legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies
  or hire assistants to aid them in their research or to attain magical might. Mage apprentices are spellcasters
  of humble skill. Some are students of accomplished mages, while others have innate powers.
