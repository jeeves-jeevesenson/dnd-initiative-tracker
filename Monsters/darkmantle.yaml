description: Unnatural subterranean hunters, darkmantles veil themselves in magical
  shadows and use their bizarre anatomies to disguise themselves as stalactites. When
  prey passes below, lurking darkmantles drop and unfurl their webbed tentacles, attempting
  to blind, suffocate, or crush their victims. Darkmantles share similarities with
  piercers and ropers and often hunt near those monsters. Scholars have attempted
  to establish a shared origin or life cycle between those creatures, but their efforts
  are thwarted by those monsters' supernatural physiologies and deadly natures.

- name: Crush
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage, and
    the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature
    and the darkmantle had Advantage on the attack roll, it covers the target, which
    has the Blinded condition and is suffocating while the darkmantle is attached
    in this way. While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack only the target
    but has Advantage on its attack rolls. Its Speed becomes 0, it can''t benefit
    from any bonus to its Speed, and it moves with the target. A creature can take
    an action to try to detach the darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful
    DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself
    by using 5 feet of movement.'
- name: Darkness Aura (1/Day)
  desc: Magical Darkness fills a 15-foot Emanation originating from the darkmantle.
    This effect lasts while the darkmantle maintains Concentration on it, up to 10
    minutes. Darkvision can't penetrate this area, and no light can illuminate it.
