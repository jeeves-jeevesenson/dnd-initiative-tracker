description: Unnatural subterranean hunters, darkmantles veil themselves in magical shadows and use their bizarre anatomies
  to disguise themselves as stalactites. When prey passes below, lurking darkmantles drop and unfurl their webbed tentacles,
  attempting to blind, suffocate, or crush their victims. Darkmantles share similarities with piercers and ropers and often
  hunt near those monsters. Scholars have attempted to establish a shared origin or life cycle between those creatures, but
  their efforts are thwarted by those monsters' supernatural physiologies and deadly natures.

actions:
- name: Crush
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle
    attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches
    by engulfing the target''s head, and the target is also {@condition blinded} and unable to breathe while the darkmantle
    is attached in this way. While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but
    has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle''s speed also becomes 0, it can''t benefit from any bonus to its speed,
    and it moves with the target. A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful {@dc 13} Strength check as an
    action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.'
- name: Darkness Aura (1/Day)
  desc: A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The
    darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains {@status concentration}, up to 10 minutes (as if {@status concentration||concentrating}
    on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness
    overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
traits:
- name: Echolocation
  desc: The darkmantle can't use its blindsight while {@condition deafened}.
- name: False Appearance
  desc: While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.
