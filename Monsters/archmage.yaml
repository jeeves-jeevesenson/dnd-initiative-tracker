description: Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords
  to reclusive witches. They study mystical secrets and possess insight into monsters,
  legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies or hire assistants to
  aid them in their research or to attain magical might.  Archmages have mastered
  incredible magical power. While some use their magic to protect the world, others
  become tyrants or pursue forbidden secrets. Many archmages retain magical servants
  and collect magic items and occult lore.
