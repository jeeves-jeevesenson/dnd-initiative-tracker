description: Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords to reclusive witches. They study mystical
  secrets and possess insight into monsters, legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies or hire assistants
  to aid them in their research or to attain magical might. Archmages have mastered incredible magical power. While some use
  their magic to protect the world, others become tyrants or pursue forbidden secrets. Many archmages retain magical servants
  and collect magic items and occult lore.
