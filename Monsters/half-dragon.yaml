description: Born through magical rites involving the essences of dragons, half-dragons serve their creators and
  their own draconic whims. Most half-dragons are created by chromatic dragons who desire servants with some trace
  of their own might and grandeur. Half-dragons frequently command other servants of a villainous dragon or act
  as agents in lands where their draconic master would attract unwanted attention. Half-dragons share personality
  traits and agendas with the dragon who spawned them. Those resembling chromatic dragons typically loathe their
  creator even as they seek the same ends. Half-dragons with the traits of metallic dragons are especially rare,
  but they might arise through magical accidents, the efforts of reckless magic-users, or the last act of a dying
  dragon.
