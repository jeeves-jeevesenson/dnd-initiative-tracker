description: From forbidden forest depths, green dragons whisper evils into the world
  and manipulate the lives of those who listen. Elusive, conniving, and egotistical,
  these chromatic dragons patiently prey on the fears of shorter-lived beings, corrupting
  and isolating them. Green dragons might lurk amid labyrinthine wildernesses for
  centuries without revealing themselves; even their most devoted followers might
  know them only as the voice of the woodlands or a whisper in their dreams. Despite
  their might, most green dragons disdain physical violence, viewing combat as servants'
  work and preferring to trick foes into dangerous or exploitative scenarios. These
  dragons collect "baubles" that embody their webs of manipulation and serve as tools
  of extortion, such as compromising documents, family heirlooms, and sentimental
  treasures.
