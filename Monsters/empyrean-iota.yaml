description: Empyrean iotas are the thoughts, memories, or indirect attentions of deities personified and given a measure
  of autonomy. Resembling floating glyphs, motes of color, icons of divinity, or stranger shapes, these beings are messengers
  of the gods and aides to those gods' servants. Iotas have their own knowledge and personalities, though they might know
  little more than the realms and wishes of their creators.
