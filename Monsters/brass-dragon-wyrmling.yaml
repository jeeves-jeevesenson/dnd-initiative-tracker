description: Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories. Although these metallic dragons
  favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they've learned,
  and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical
  sleep and searing them with flame. Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and
  they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms,
  disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others' stories. Brass
  dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a nostalgic
  memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and the crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty
  could occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon's hoard.

  desc: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons. The dragon exhales fire in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide.
    Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that
    area must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or fall {@condition unconscious} for 1 minute. This effect ends
    for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
