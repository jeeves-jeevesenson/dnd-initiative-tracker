description: Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to
  their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical,
  martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal. Hobgoblins
  often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans.
  Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise
  them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing
  across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond. Hobgoblin warlords lead armies of
  hobgoblins and their allies, using their experience and strategic minds to command amid the ebb and flow of battle.
