description: Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to their whims.
  Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent
  on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal. Hobgoblins often subjugate animals,
  monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons,
  warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should
  hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars
  and planes of existence beyond. Hobgoblin warlords lead armies of hobgoblins and their allies, using their experience and
  strategic minds to command amid the ebb and flow of battle.
