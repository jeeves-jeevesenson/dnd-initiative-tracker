description: Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such
  drives by bending the world to their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories
  and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent
  on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist
  zeal. Hobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly
  goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords,
  the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control
  of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new
  conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of
  existence beyond.  Hobgoblin warlords lead armies of hobgoblins and their allies,
  using their experience and strategic minds to command amid the ebb and flow of battle.
