description: Those desperate to escape death sometimes make terrible bargains with
  wicked deities. Devoting their hearts to evil forces, these villains gain power
  over death and a cursed immortality that binds their minds and spirits within a
  desiccated corpse. Freed from mortal concerns, these mummy lords pursue their obsessions
  across ages. Most mummy lords linger amid the ruins of ancient palaces or temples
  where they once held sway. Their age-old faith and ties to deathly forces grant
  them fearful magic, which they use to sow ruin and animate undead servants. A mummy
  lord's heart embodies the pact that grants it immortality. Rather than bearing its
  heart within its corpse, a mummy lord removes and hides this accursed organ. As
  long as its heart isn't destroyed by fire, a mummy lord can return to unlife no
  matter what doom it meets. Mummy lords are usually consumed by ageless plots.
