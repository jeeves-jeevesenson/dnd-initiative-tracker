description: Those desperate to escape death sometimes make terrible bargains with wicked deities. Devoting their hearts to
  evil forces, these villains gain power over death and a cursed immortality that binds their minds and spirits within a desiccated
  corpse. Freed from mortal concerns, these mummy lords pursue their obsessions across ages. Most mummy lords linger amid
  the ruins of ancient palaces or temples where they once held sway. Their age-old faith and ties to deathly forces grant
  them fearful magic, which they use to sow ruin and animate undead servants. A mummy lord's heart embodies the pact that
  grants it immortality. Rather than bearing its heart within its corpse, a mummy lord removes and hides this accursed organ.
  As long as its heart isn't destroyed by fire, a mummy lord can return to unlife no matter what doom it meets. Mummy lords
  are usually consumed by ageless plots.
