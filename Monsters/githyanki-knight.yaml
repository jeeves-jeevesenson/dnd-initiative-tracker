description: Githyanki knights wield silver blades to slay magic-users who use the Astral Projection spell to intrude on githyanki
  territories on the Astral Plane. These silver blades are sacred to the githyanki. Non-githyanki who claim these weapons
  often find themselves hunted by wrathful githyanki knights.
