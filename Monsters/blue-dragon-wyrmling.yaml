description: Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave control and collect followers
  like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform their territories into empires, domains to be feared
  by nations. Blue dragons have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades
  of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops
  they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants,
  the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers. Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces
  fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind
  gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.
