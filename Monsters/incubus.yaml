description: Incubi exploit the vulnerability of mortal dreams. Slipping into the
  homes of sleepers, incubi feed off dreams and replace them with terrifying nightmares.
  Incubi visit victims nightly until their prey expires. The incubi then hunt for
  new victims, preferring the loved ones of past targets. Incubi can transform into
  succubi and vice versa, taking the forms they need to manipulate foes in dreams
  or in the flesh. Those visited by an incubus have recurring nightmares.
