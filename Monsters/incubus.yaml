description: Incubi exploit the vulnerability of mortal dreams. Slipping into the homes of sleepers, incubi feed off dreams
  and replace them with terrifying nightmares. Incubi visit victims nightly until their prey expires. The incubi then hunt
  for new victims, preferring the loved ones of past targets. Incubi can transform into succubi and vice versa, taking the
  forms they need to manipulate foes in dreams or in the flesh. Those visited by an incubus have recurring nightmares.

traits:
- name: Telepathic Bond
  desc: The fiend ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when communicating with a creature it has {@condition charmed}.
    The two don't even need to be on the same plane of existence.
- name: Shapechanger
  desc: The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings,
    the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment
    it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

- name: Claw (Fiend Form Only)
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage.'
- name: Charm
  desc: One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be magically
    {@condition charmed} for 1 day. The {@condition charmed} target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the
    target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
    If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's
    Charm for the next 24 hours. The fiend can have only one target {@condition charmed} at a time. If it charms another,
    the effect on the previous target ends.
- name: Draining Kiss
  desc: The fiend kisses a creature {@condition charmed} by it or a willing creature. The target must make a {@dc 15} Constitution
    saving throw against this magic, taking 32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction
    lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
- name: Etherealness
  desc: The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.
