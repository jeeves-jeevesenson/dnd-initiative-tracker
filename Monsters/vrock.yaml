- name: Spores {@recharge}
  desc: A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature
    in that area must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned}
    in this way, a target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the
    saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water
    on the target also ends the effect on it.

  desc: The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must
    succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of the vrock's next turn.
