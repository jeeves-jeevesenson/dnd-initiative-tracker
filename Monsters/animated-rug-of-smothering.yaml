description: Animated rugs of smothering might attack any creature that steps on them,
  or they might be passed off as superficially similar magic items, such as Carpets
  of Flying, and attack those who speak a supposed command word. Deadly tapestries,
  furs, and similar items also use this stat block.
habitat: Urban
actions:
- name: Smother
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 5 ft. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage.
    If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the rug can give it the Grappled
    condition (escape DC 13) instead of dealing damage. Until the grapple ends, the
    target has the Blinded and Restrained conditions, is suffocating, and takes 10
    (2d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The rug can smother
    only one creature at a time. While grappling the target, the rug can''t take this
    action, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes
    the same amount of damage.'
