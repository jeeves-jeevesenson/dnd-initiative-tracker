description: Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes,
  and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust
  laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders. Bandit deceivers use magic to disguise their activities
  or create flashy distractions.
