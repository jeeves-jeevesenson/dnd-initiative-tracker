description: ''
habitat: Underdark
traits:
- name: Detect Sentience
  desc: The intellect devourer can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence
    of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a {@spell mind blank} spell.
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and uses Devour Intellect.
- name: Claws
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 2d4 + 2}) slashing damage.'
- name: Devour Intellect
  desc: 'The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed
    on a {@dc 12} Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 ({@damage 2d10}) psychic damage. Also on a failure,
    roll {@dice 3d6}: If the total equals or exceeds the target''s Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target
    is {@condition stunned} until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.'
- name: Body Thief
  desc: The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an {@condition incapacitated} humanoid within 5 feet
    of it that isn't protected by {@spell protection from evil and good}. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically
    consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a
    creature, the intellect devourer has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects originating outside
    its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of
    Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature
    knew, including spells and languages. If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A {@spell protection
    from evil and good} spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out
    if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a {@spell wish}. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect
    devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then
    dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.
