description: Doppelgangers are supernatural beings with the ability to shape-shift into any humanlike form. Their mind-reading
  abilities aid them in creating near-perfect disguises and plucking secrets from unguarded minds. Occasionally, doppelgangers
  use their shape-shifting ability in more overt ways, transforming into unsettling forms to frighten foes.

actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.
- name: Slam
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Read Thoughts
  desc: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate
    barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the
    target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's {@status concentration}
    isn't broken (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger
    has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) and Charisma ({@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion})
    checks against the target.
traits:
- name: Shapechanger
  desc: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true
    form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
    It reverts to its true form if it dies.

  desc: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it {@status surprised}.
- name: Surprise Attack
