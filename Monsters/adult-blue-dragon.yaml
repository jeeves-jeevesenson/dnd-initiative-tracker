description: Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave control and collect followers like other
  dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations. Blue dragons
  have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades of stormy skies. They dwell in
  deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs
  near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised
  by their followers. Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest
  in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items
  capable of spreading the dragons' influence.
