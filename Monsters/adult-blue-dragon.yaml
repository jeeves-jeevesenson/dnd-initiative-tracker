description: Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave
  control and collect followers like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform
  their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations. Blue dragons have
  sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades
  of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic
  spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic
  power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires,
  or monuments raised by their followers. Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces
  fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are
  common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals,
  and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.
