- name: Change Shape
  desc: The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own,

    but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains
    any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but
    that it lacks.
