description: From forbidden forest depths, green dragons whisper evils into the world and manipulate the lives of
  those who listen. Elusive, conniving, and egotistical, these chromatic dragons patiently prey on the fears of
  shorter-lived beings, corrupting and isolating them. Green dragons might lurk amid labyrinthine wildernesses for
  centuries without revealing themselves; even their most devoted followers might know them only as the voice of
  the woodlands or a whisper in their dreams. Despite their might, most green dragons disdain physical violence,
  viewing combat as servants' work and preferring to trick foes into dangerous or exploitative scenarios. These
  dragons collect "baubles" that embody their webs of manipulation and serve as tools of extortion, such as compromising
  documents, family heirlooms, and sentimental treasures.
