  desc: The kraken can breathe air and water.
- name: Freedom of Movement
  desc: The kraken ignores {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be

    a Large or smaller creature {@condition grappled} by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
    swallowed, the creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover}
    against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 ({@damage 12d6}) acid damage at the start of each
    of the kraken''s turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must
    succeed on a {@dc 25} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which
    fall {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer
    {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.'
- name: Tentacle
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 17} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 3d6 + 10}) bludgeoning damage, and the target
    is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 18}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained}. The kraken
    has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.'
- name: Fling
  desc: One Large or smaller object held or creature {@condition grappled} by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random
    direction and knocked {@condition prone}. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6})
    bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed
    on a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked {@condition prone}.
- name: Lightning Storm
  desc: The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within
    120 feet of it. A target must make a {@dc 23} Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 4d10}) lightning damage on a
    failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- name: Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)
  desc: The kraken uses Lightning Storm.
- name: Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)
  desc: While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area
    is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must
    succeed on a {@dc 23} Constitution saving throw, taking 16 ({@damage 3d10}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
    much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's
    next turn.
