description: Shadows are incorporeal Undead that feed on life. They resent the living
  for possessing the potential and vitality lost to them. Shadows lurk in dark, lonely
  places, typically sites that were meaningful to them in life or cursed places with
  ties to death, sinister magic, or the Shadowfell. Their victims rise as new shadows
  and prey on the living. Shadows might resemble the silhouettes of who they were
  in life or take on more menacing forms.
