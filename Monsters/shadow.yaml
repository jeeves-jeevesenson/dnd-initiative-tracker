description: Shadows are incorporeal Undead that feed on life. They resent the living for possessing the potential
  and vitality lost to them. Shadows lurk in dark, lonely places, typically sites that were meaningful to them in
  life or cursed places with ties to death, sinister magic, or the Shadowfell. Their victims rise as new shadows
  and prey on the living. Shadows might resemble the silhouettes of who they were in life or take on more menacing
  forms.
