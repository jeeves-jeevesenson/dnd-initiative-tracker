description: Assassins are professional killers skilled at stealthily approaching their victims and striking unseen.
  Most assassins kill for a reason, perhaps hiring themselves out to wealthy patrons or slaying for an unscrupulous
  cause. They use poisons and other deadly tools, and they might carry equipment to help them break into secure
  areas or avoid capture. Many assassins adhere to a professional code or exhibit some signature quirk.
