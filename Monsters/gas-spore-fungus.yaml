description: Gas spores are floating, orbicular fungi with rhizome growths and protuberances that resemble the stalks
  and eyes of beholders. If destroyed, a gas spore explodes in a poisonous burst that can infect creatures and slay
  them in hours. Infected corpses spawn more gas spores that grow to full size in a matter of days.
