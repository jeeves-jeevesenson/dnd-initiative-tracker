description: Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons
  scheme for power and wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule
  over what remains. Black dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns and
  withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant
  swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their
  acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and leaving
  nature with festering wounds. Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and
  relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons
  prize it—particularly if they were responsible for it being lost.
