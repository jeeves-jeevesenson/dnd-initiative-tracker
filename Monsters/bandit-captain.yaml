description: Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes,
  and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust
  laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders. Bandit captains command gangs of scoundrels and conduct
  straightforward heists. Others serve as guards and muscle for more influential criminals.
