description: Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes,
  and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation,
  or the threats of merciless leaders. Bandit captains command gangs of scoundrels and conduct straightforward heists. Others
  serve as guards and muscle for more influential criminals.
