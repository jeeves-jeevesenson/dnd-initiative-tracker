description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss. Their corruption and violence delighted
  the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been
  the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains. Gnolls possessed by demonic vestiges
  of the demon lord Yeenoghu, fangs of Yeenoghu direct the chaos of gnoll packs. Along the way, these fanatics seek grisly
  omens from Yeenoghu and strive to interpret the demon lord's vicious goals.
