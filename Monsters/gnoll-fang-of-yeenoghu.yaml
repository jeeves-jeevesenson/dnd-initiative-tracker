description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss.
  Their corruption and violence delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged
  their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been
  the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains.  Gnolls
  possessed by demonic vestiges of the demon lord Yeenoghu, fangs of Yeenoghu direct
  the chaos of gnoll packs. Along the way, these fanatics seek grisly omens from Yeenoghu
  and strive to interpret the demon lord's vicious goals.
