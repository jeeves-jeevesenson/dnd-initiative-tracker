description: Almost as numerous as red slaadi, blue slaadi are muscular brutes with vicious blades extending from the backs
  of their claws. These claws carry a magical curse called chaos phage, which can transform victims into red or green slaadi.
  Blue slaadi accompany red slaadi and behave similarly. They innately know the signs of chaos phage and avoid slaying creatures
  that carry it or other slaad curses.

actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: 'The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.'
- name: Bite
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage.'
- name: Claw
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is
    a humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage.
    While infected, the target can''t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 ({@dice 3d6}) every 24
    hours. If the disease reduces the target''s hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a {@creature
    red slaad} or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a {@creature green slaad}. Only a {@spell
    wish} spell can reverse the transformation.'
