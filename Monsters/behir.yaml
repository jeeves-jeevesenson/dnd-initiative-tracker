actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: 'The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.'
- name: Bite
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) piercing damage.'
- name: Constrict
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage
    plus 17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) slashing damage. The target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}) if the behir isn''t
    already constricting a creature, and the target is {@condition restrained} until this grapple ends.'
- name: Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}
  desc: The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a
    {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one.
- name: Swallow
  desc: The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target
    is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained},
    it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 ({@damage
    6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If
    the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution
    saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls {@condition prone} in a space within 10
    feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from
    the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.
