description: From forbidden forest depths, green dragons whisper evils into the world and manipulate the lives of those who
  listen. Elusive, conniving, and egotistical, these chromatic dragons patiently prey on the fears of shorter-lived beings,
  corrupting and isolating them. Green dragons might lurk amid labyrinthine wildernesses for centuries without revealing themselves;
  even their most devoted followers might know them only as the voice of the woodlands or a whisper in their dreams. Despite
  their might, most green dragons disdain physical violence, viewing combat as servants' work and preferring to trick foes
  into dangerous or exploitative scenarios. These dragons collect "baubles" that embody their webs of manipulation and serve
  as tools of extortion, such as compromising documents, family heirlooms, and sentimental treasures.
