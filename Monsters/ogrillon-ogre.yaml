description: Ogres are selfish raiders and hulking gluttons spawned of hateful supernatural forces. From dismal
  ruins and bleak hinterlands, they raid vulnerable communities and ambush travelers. Ogres covet food and treasure,
  and they spitefully destroy art, books, clockwork devices, and other delicate or lovingly made things. Occasionally
  they kidnap victims to eat later or, more rarely, performers who catch their interest. Ogres trace their origins
  to wrathful deities such as Erythnul, Takhisis, and Vaprak. They magically emerge from the earth of lands corrupted
  by evil gods, sinister magic, or ancient curses. Some bear evidence of the places that spawned them, sporting
  rocky calluses, mossy growths, or frozen scars. Ogrillons arise from Humanoids cursed by foul magic or the will
  of wrathful deities. They appear similar to whoever they once were, but they grow to over 8 feet tall and gain
  ogre-like features. Ogrillons constantly seethe with supernatural anger, which they might struggle to control
  or purposefully vent on other creatures.
