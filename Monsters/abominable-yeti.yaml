description: Giants even among their own intimidating kind, abominable yetis are stronger and bloodthirstier than
  their kin. They claim whole regions as their hunting grounds, and they might track trespassers for days. On sighting
  prey, abominable yetis fling boulders of ice and snow before closing to finish foes. In addition to their icy
  claws and gaze, they can exhale a blast of arctic cold. Abominable yetis dwell in frigid ruins or the deserted
  lairs of other monsters atop infamous peaks.
