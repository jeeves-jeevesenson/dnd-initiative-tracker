description: Giants even among their own intimidating kind, abominable yetis are stronger
  and bloodthirstier than their kin. They claim whole regions as their hunting grounds,
  and they might track trespassers for days. On sighting prey, abominable yetis fling
  boulders of ice and snow before closing to finish foes. In addition to their icy
  claws and gaze, they can exhale a blast of arctic cold. Abominable yetis dwell in
  frigid ruins or the deserted lairs of other monsters atop infamous peaks.
