description: Black puddings are shapeless masses of predatory cells. Once a pudding detects organic matter, it oozes
  toward its prey, dissolving living matter and various objects. If a black pudding is split by lightning or slashing
  attacks, it divides into two smaller, independent puddings. Various supernatural conditions might bring black
  puddings into being.

  desc: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.
- name: Corrosive Form
  desc: A creature that hits the pudding with a melee attack roll takes 4 (1d8) Acid damage. Nonmagical ammunition
    is destroyed immediately after hitting the pudding and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative
    −1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the pudding and coming into contact with it.
    The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches −5. The penalty can be removed by casting the Mending spell on
    the weapon. In 1 minute, the pudding can eat through 2 feet of nonmagical wood or metal.

    can be removed by casting the Mending spell on the armor.'
