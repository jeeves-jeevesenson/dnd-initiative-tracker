description: Black puddings are shapeless masses of predatory cells. Once a pudding detects organic matter, it oozes toward
  its prey, dissolving living matter and various objects. If a black pudding is split by lightning or slashing attacks, it
  divides into two smaller, independent puddings. Various supernatural conditions might bring black puddings into being.
