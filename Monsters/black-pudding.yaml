description: Black puddings are shapeless masses of predatory cells. Once a pudding
  detects organic matter, it oozes toward its prey, dissolving living matter and various
  objects. If a black pudding is split by lightning or slashing attacks, it divides
  into two smaller, independent puddings. Various supernatural conditions might bring
  black puddings into being.
habitat: Underdark
traits:
- name: Amorphous
  desc: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending
    extra movement to do so.
- name: Corrosive Form
  desc: A creature that hits the pudding with a melee attack roll takes 4 (1d8) Acid
    damage. Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the pudding
    and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative −1 penalty to
    attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the pudding and coming into contact
    with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches −5. The penalty can be
    removed by casting the Mending spell on the weapon. In 1 minute, the pudding can
    eat through 2 feet of nonmagical wood or metal.

    needing to make an ability check.
actions:
- name: Dissolving Pseudopod
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll: +5, reach 10 ft. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) Acid damage. Nonmagical
    armor worn by the target takes a −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is
    destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting
    the Mending spell on the armor.'
- name: Split
  desc: 'Trigger: While the pudding is Large or Medium and has 10+ Hit Points, it
    becomes Bloodied or is subjected to Lightning or Slashing damage. Response: The
    pudding splits into two new Black Puddings. Each new pudding is one size smaller
    than the original pudding and acts on its Initiative. The original pudding''s
    Hit Points are divided evenly between the new puddings (round down).'
