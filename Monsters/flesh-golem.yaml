description: ''
habitat: Any
treasure: Arcana
traits:
- name: Aversion to Fire
  desc: If the golem takes Fire damage, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of
    its next turn.
- name: Berserk
  desc: Whenever the golem starts its turn Bloodied, roll 1d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
    while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and
    attack, the golem attacks an object. Once the golem goes berserk, it remains so until it is destroyed or it
    is no longer Bloodied. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by taking
    an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; the golem must be able to hear its creator. If this check
    succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk until the start of its next turn, at which point it resumes rolling
    for the Berserk trait again if it is still Bloodied.
