description: ''
habitat: Any
treasure: Arcana
traits:
- name: Berserk
  desc: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 6, the golem goes berserk.
    On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to
    move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes
    berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The golem's creator, if within 60
    feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its
    creator, who must take an action to make a {@dc 15} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the check succeeds, the golem
    ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.
