traits:
- name: Petrifying Gaze
  desc: If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk
    can force the creature to make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't {@condition incapacitated}.
    On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. It must repeat the saving
    throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is {@condition petrified}
    until freed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic. A creature that isn't {@status surprised} can avert
    its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start
    of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make
    the save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and
    targets itself with its gaze.
