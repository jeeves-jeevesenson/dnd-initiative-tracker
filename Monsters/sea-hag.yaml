description: Sea hags loathe peace and beauty. Bitter, jealous creatures, they spread chaos and undermine joy however they
  can, undertaking elaborate deceptions to sow discord for its own sake. The hags' true forms are supernaturally vile, and
  their baleful gazes can strike down creatures frightened by their appearance. Sea hags cloak themselves in illusions to
  work their schemes.
habitat: Coastal, Underwater
treasure: Arcana
traits:
- name: Amphibious
  desc: The hag can breathe air and water.
- name: Horrific Appearance
  desc: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a {@dc 11} Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
    throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself
    on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's
    Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours. Unless the target is {@status surprised} or the revelation of the hag's true
    form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn,
    a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.
actions:
- name: Claws
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) slashing damage.'
- name: Death Glare
  desc: The hag targets one {@condition frightened} creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the
    hag, it must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
- name: Illusory Appearance
  desc: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an
    ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if
    she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear
    to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually
    inspect the illusion and succeed on a {@dc 16} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the hag is
    disguised.
