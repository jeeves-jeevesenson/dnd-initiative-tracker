description: Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories.
  Although these metallic dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable
  distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they've learned, and collect
  news. Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk from combat when necessary,
  thwarting foes with magical sleep and searing them with flame. Brass dragons favor
  warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually dwell
  near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting
  Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers,
  or anyone else invested in others' stories. Brass dragons collect eclectic objects.
  While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a
  nostalgic memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and
  the crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty could occupy the same shelf in
  a brass dragon's hoard.
