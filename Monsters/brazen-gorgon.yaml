description: Followers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the process of creating
  gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons
  are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal bodies glow with intense heat. When
  they charge their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to ensnare enemies
  and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated
  to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.
