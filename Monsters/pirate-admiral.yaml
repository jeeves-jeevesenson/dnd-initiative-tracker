description: Pirate admirals command whole pirate fleets. They undertake audacious
  ventures, such as challenging the navies of coastal nations, hunting legendary sea
  creatures, or carving out their own pirate kingdoms. Pirate admirals might launch
  their fleets from hidden fortresses where they hoard their treasure—or keep maps
  to where they've hidden their riches. Some pirate admirals ally with the followers
  of oceanic deities, underwater dwellers, and sea monsters, as well as their fellow
  scalawags.
