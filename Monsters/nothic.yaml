description: Consumed by their thirst for forbidden knowledge, nothics are cursed
  lore seekers transformed by secrets never meant to be known. The bodies of these
  former scholars are warped into otherworldly shapes, each with a head dominated
  by a gigantic, unblinking eye. Nothics remember nothing of their past lives and
  care only for their endless pursuit of hidden mysteries and uncanny truths. They
  seek revelations amid the rubble of forgotten ruins, and they use their supernatural
  sight to pierce magical deceptions, rot the flesh of enemies, and steal the secrets
  of those who interrupt their investigations. Some nothics seek to end the curse
  that warped them into their bizarre forms, but many are unaware of—or uninterested
  in—their transformation.
