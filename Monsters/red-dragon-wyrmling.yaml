description: Red dragons take whatever they desire and burn to ash anything that stands in their way. These chromatic dragons
  endlessly desire more—more magic, territory, treasure, or whatever else inflames their cruel ambitions. Red dragons make
  their lairs amid perilous cliffs and volcanoes. Within, they amass and fiercely protect hoards of treasure, and many have
  perfect recall of the hoards' contents and the locations of all they've collected. Should anything go missing, red dragons
  fly into rages. They don't rest until their treasures are returned and the thieves have burned. Red dragons believe themselves
  to be the greatest of all dragons and, by extension, the greatest of all creatures. To them, pillaging and conquering are
  their right—treasures can find no more honored place than in their hoards, and other creatures are privileged to serve them.
