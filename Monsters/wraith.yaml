description: Wraiths are spectral evils, life-hungry embodiments of malice and terror. Arising from the souls of tyrants,
  moments of catastrophic pain, or magical blasphemies, wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. Humanoids that
  die near a wraith might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as specters bound to the wraith's sinister will. Wraiths
  lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins, or lands influenced by sinister planes of existence. Such haunted domains might
  bear hints of the tragedies or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being. Wraiths might arise from a single powerfully
  evil soul or other baleful forces.
