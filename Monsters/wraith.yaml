description: Wraiths are spectral evils, life-hungry embodiments of malice and terror.
  Arising from the souls of tyrants, moments of catastrophic pain, or magical blasphemies,
  wraiths spread suffering and the torment of undeath. Humanoids that die near a wraith
  might be entrapped by the foul spirit and rise as  specters  bound to the wraith's
  sinister will. Wraiths lurk in forgotten dungeons, accursed ruins, or lands influenced
  by sinister planes of existence. Such haunted domains might bear hints of the tragedies
  or foul magic that brought the wraiths into being. Wraiths might arise from a single
  powerfully evil soul or other baleful forces.

    wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control
    at a time.
