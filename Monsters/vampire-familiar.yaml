description: Vampire familiars are living people who serve vampires, either willingly or due to coercion by their deathless
  masters. They channel deathly energy through their weapons, incapacitating unsuspecting targets and leaving their victims
  as helpless prey for their vampire masters. Many vampire familiars aspire to eventually become vampires, while others are
  magically charmed or serve as part of some terrible bargain. In each case, these vampire servants show signs of their vampiric
  corruption, such as corpse-like complexions, uncanny reflexes, and evidence of their masters' repeated feedings. A vampire
  familiar loses its supernatural abilities and returns to its original Humanoid state if its vampire master is destroyed.
