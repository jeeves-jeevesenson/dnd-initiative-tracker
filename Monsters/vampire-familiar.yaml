description: Vampire familiars are living people who serve vampires, either willingly or due to coercion by their
  deathless masters. They channel deathly energy through their weapons, incapacitating unsuspecting targets and
  leaving their victims as helpless prey for their vampire masters. Many vampire familiars aspire to eventually
  become vampires, while others are magically charmed or serve as part of some terrible bargain. In each case, these
  vampire servants show signs of their vampiric corruption, such as corpse-like complexions, uncanny reflexes, and
  evidence of their masters' repeated feedings. A vampire familiar loses its supernatural abilities and returns
  to its original Humanoid state if its vampire master is destroyed.
