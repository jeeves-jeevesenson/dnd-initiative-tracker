description: Lone crawling claws can continue killing sprees they perpetrated in life. Some recklessly attack the
  living, while others pursue specific victims. In rare cases, a crawling claw wreaks mayhem while the rest of its
  body still lives, with the original creature potentially unaware of its severed hand's crimes.
