description: Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords to reclusive witches. They study mystical
  secrets and possess insight into monsters, legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies or hire assistants
  to aid them in their research or to attain magical might. Mages are accomplished spellcasters whose lives have been shaped
  by magic. They can use their powers to defend or dominate other creatures, or they could focus on magical research and unlocking
  mystical secrets.
