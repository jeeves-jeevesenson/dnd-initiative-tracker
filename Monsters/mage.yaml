description: Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords
  to reclusive witches. They study mystical secrets and possess insight into monsters,
  legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies or hire assistants to
  aid them in their research or to attain magical might.  Mages are accomplished spellcasters
  whose lives have been shaped by magic. They can use their powers to defend or dominate
  other creatures, or they could focus on magical research and unlocking mystical
  secrets.
