description: Needle blights have vaguely bipedal forms, with gaunt, misshapen limbs. Whether standing unnaturally still or
  lurching with their awkward gaits, these blights can't pass as either normal plants or woodland travelers. Once they spot
  foes, needle blights attack using their thorn-covered claws or by rapidly growing and flinging volleys of serrated, needlelike
  projectiles.
