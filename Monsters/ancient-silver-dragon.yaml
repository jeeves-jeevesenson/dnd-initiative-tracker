description: Silver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency while
  remaining watchful against evil. Silver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations and congeniality
  drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with artists, historians, knights,
  and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures. Silver dragons take inspiration from legendary heroes
  and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories, ancient art, and the gear
  of famous champions.
