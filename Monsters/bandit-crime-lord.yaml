description: Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals
  include gang members, desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits
  are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation,
  or the threats of merciless leaders.  Bandit crime lords manipulate shadowy organizations
  and prioritize their own survival over any single lackey or plot.
