- name: Create Whirlwind
  desc: A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet
    of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating}
    on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or
    be {@condition restrained} by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures {@condition
    restrained} by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it. A creature can use its
    action to free a creature {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a {@dc 18} Strength
    check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer {@condition restrained} and moves to the nearest space outside
    the whirlwind.
