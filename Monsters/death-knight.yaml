description: Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering commanders with grim histories. Some strive to
  end the curses that doom them to undeath, though their selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others,
  like the infamous death knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing themselves to action only
  when something reignites their deathless evil.
