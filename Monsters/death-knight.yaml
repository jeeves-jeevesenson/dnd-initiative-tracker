description: Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering commanders with grim
  histories. Some strive to end the curses that doom them to undeath, though their
  selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others, like the infamous death
  knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing themselves to action
  only when something reignites their deathless evil.
