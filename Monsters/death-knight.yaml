description: Death knights are deadly combatants and domineering commanders with grim histories. Some strive to end the curses
  that doom them to undeath, though their selfish souls eternally shackle them to their fates. Others, like the infamous death
  knight Lord Soth, brood in dismal ruins for centuries, rousing themselves to action only when something reignites their
  deathless evil.
