description: Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white dragons prioritize survival
  over all. Life is harsh and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and
  frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their territories,
  scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons
  ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only
  with their own survival. White dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other
  deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters,
  white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the
  gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect
  such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth
  in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the
  details of which inflate as these dragons age.
