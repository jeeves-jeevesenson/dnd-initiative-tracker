description: Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white dragons prioritize survival over all. Life is harsh and uncertain
  in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their
  territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller
  creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival. White dragons create lairs to defend themselves
  from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments
  to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest.
  To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white
  dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.
