- name: Eye Rays
  desc: The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 feet
    of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn. The target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw, or it can't
    take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee
    or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on its
    turn. The target must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target
    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The target must
    succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving
    throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect
    on itself on a success. The target must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw, taking 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
