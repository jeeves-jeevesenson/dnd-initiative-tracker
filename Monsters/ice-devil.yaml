- name: Wall of Ice {@recharge}
  desc: The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1
    foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter. When the wall
    appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
    wall to end up on, unless the creature is {@condition incapacitated}. The creature then makes a {@dc 17} Dexterity saving
    throw, taking 35 ({@damage 10d6}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall lasts
    for 1 minute or until the devil is {@condition incapacitated} or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot
    section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic
    damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature
    finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a {@dc 17} Constitution
    saving throw, taking 17 ({@damage 5d6}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The
    frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.
