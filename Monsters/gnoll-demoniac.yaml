description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss.
  Their corruption and violence delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged
  their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since, gnolls have been
  the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains.  Gnoll
  demoniacs are berserkers that arise from gnolls who've ritualistically fed on flesh
  corrupted by the Abyss. Now embodying the ruinous hunger of Yeenoghu, these gnolls
  throw themselves into battle, heedless of odds or their own survival. Rampaging
  demoniacs even devour other gnolls in their wild frenzies.
