description: Cowardly cousins to chromatic dragons, kobolds serve draconic overlords
  as warriors and servants. These scrappy menaces mimic the behaviors of their dragon
  masters. Though their small stature and recklessness make kobolds poor imitators
  of dragons, what they lack in ferocity they make up for in zeal and ingenuity. They
  are especially adept at creating traps and setting ambushes. Kobolds' scales resemble
  those of chromatic dragons that live near their warrens. Rarely, kobolds possess
  features evocative of metallic dragons or other dragon-like creatures.  Some kobolds
  are born with wings. Called urds by others of their kind, these kobolds are thought
  to be blessed by a dragon or Tiamat, the Dragon Queen. Despite their favored status,
  winged kobolds are as cowardly as their brethren and use their flight mostly to
  keep out of reach of their foes.
