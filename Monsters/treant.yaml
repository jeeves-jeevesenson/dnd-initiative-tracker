- name: Slam

- name: Hail of Bark
  desc: 'Ranged Attack Roll : +10, range 180 ft. Hit : 28 (4d10 + 6) Piercing damage.'
- name: Animate Trees (1/Day)
  desc: The treant magically animates up to two trees it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each tree uses the Treant
    stat block, except it has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, it can't speak, and it lacks this action. The
    tree takes its turn immediately after the treant on the same Initiative count, and it obeys the treant. A tree
    remains animate for 1 day or until it dies, the treant dies, or it is more than 120 feet from the treant. The
    tree then takes root if possible.
