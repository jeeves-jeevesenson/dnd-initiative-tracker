- name: Slam
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll: +10, reach 5 ft. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) Bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Hail of Bark
  desc: 'Ranged Attack Roll: +10, range 180 ft. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) Piercing damage.'
- name: Animate Trees (1/Day)
  desc: The treant magically animates up to two trees it can see within 60 feet of
    itself. Each tree uses the Treant stat block, except it has Intelligence and Charisma
    scores of 1, it can't speak, and it lacks this action. The tree takes its turn
    immediately after the treant on the same Initiative count, and it obeys the treant.
    A tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies, the treant dies, or it is more
    than 120 feet from the treant. The tree then takes root if possible.
