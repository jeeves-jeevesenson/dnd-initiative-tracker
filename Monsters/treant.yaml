description: ''
habitat: Forest
traits:
- name: False Appearance
  desc: While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.
- name: Siege Monster
  desc: The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: The treant makes two slam attacks.
- name: Slam
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Rock
  desc: '{@atk rw} {@hit 10} to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Animate Trees (1/Day)
  desc: The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics
    as a {@creature treant}, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only
    the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it
    dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it
    back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
