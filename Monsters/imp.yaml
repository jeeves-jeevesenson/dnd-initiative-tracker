description: Known for their cowardice and toadying, imps serve devils and wicked
  magic-users. Their abilities to shape-shift and pass unseen make them skillful spies
  and adept at fleeing danger. Imps sent to surveil other creatures relate what they
  discover to their masters, but they frequently omit important details or cast events
  in the worst possible light to mislead their masters into following the imps' devilish
  council.  Imps without masters delight in manipulating other creatures and inflating
  their own egos. They might take over bands of weaker monsters, or they might pose
  as helpful spirits and trick influential individuals into pursuing nefarious ends.
