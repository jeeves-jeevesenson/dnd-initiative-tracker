description: Full-grown remorhazes are single-minded ambush predators. They attempt to bite prey and trap it against their
  searing bodies, then swallow their meal whole. Remorhazes eat as much as they can, since they might go months without feeding.

    the target is {@condition restrained}, and the remorhaz can''t bite another target.'
- name: Swallow
  desc: The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that
    creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is {@condition
    blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside
    the remorhaz, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns. If the remorhaz
    takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution
    saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in a space
    within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it
    and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.
