description: Full-grown remorhazes are single-minded ambush predators. They attempt
  to bite prey and trap it against their searing bodies, then swallow their meal whole.
  Remorhazes eat as much as they can, since they might go months without feeding.

traits:
- name: Heat Aura
  desc: At the end of each of the remorhaz's turns, each creature in a 5-foot Emanation
    originating from the remorhaz takes 16 (3d10) Fire damage.

- name: Bite
  desc: 'Melee Attack Roll: +11, reach 10 ft. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) Piercing damage plus
    14 (4d6) Fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the
    Grappled condition (escape DC 17), and it has the Restrained condition until the
    grapple ends.'
- name: Swallow
  desc: 'Strength Saving Throw: DC 19, one Large or smaller creature Grappled by the
    remorhaz (it can have up to two creatures swallowed at a time). Failure: The target
    is swallowed by the remorhaz, and the Grappled condition ends. A swallowed creature
    has the Blinded and Restrained conditions, it has Total Cover against attacks
    and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage plus
    10 (3d6) Fire damage at the start of each of the remorhaz''s turns. If the remorhaz
    takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz
    must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
    all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 5 feet of the remorhaz
    and has the Prone condition. If the remorhaz dies, any swallowed creature no longer
    has the Restrained condition and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of
    movement, exiting Prone.'
