description: Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods,
  making them easy to mistake for normal plants, while others patrol regions of natural
  power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life by influences from the Feywild,
  which make them colorful and endlessly blooming, or by Shadowfell energy, which
  covers them with grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless.
