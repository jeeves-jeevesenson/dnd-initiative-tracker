description: Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods, making them easy to mistake
  for normal plants, while others patrol regions of natural power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life
  by influences from the Feywild, which make them colorful and endlessly blooming, or by Shadowfell energy, which
  covers them with grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless.
