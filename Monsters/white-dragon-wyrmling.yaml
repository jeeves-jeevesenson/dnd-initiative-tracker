description: Among the most primal chromatic dragons, white dragons prioritize survival over all. Life is harsh
  and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons
  fiercely protect their territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white
  dragons ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival.
  White dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural
  conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls,
  the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect such treasure, white dragons
  coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure
  embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.
