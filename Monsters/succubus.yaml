description: Succubi prey on mortals physically and exploit their waking desires.
  They relish corrupting virtuous souls and the pain an individual's downfall can
  cause. Once their targets are at their lowest, succubi slay their victims with their
  essence-draining kiss. Through fiendish rites, succubi can transform into incubi
  to manipulate their prey in dreams as well as the waking world. They can also change
  shape to torment their victims. These tempters can dominate Humanoids, but they
  usually do so to reinforce their manipulations or defend themselves rather than
  controlling others outright.
