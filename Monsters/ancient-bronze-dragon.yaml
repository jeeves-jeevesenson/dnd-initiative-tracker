description: Where bronze dragons dwell, wonders flourish. Imaginative yet mindful, these metallic dragons work
  toward greatness and help others achieve all they can. They strive to preserve innovations, from the works of
  past civilizations to new discoveries, and they share such works widely. When dealing with shorter-lived beings,
  bronze dragons prefer to win them over through conversation and cultivation, but they don't shy from battle when
  villains keep others from achieving their potential. Bronze dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities
  of the sea, and they often make their lairs in places of natural beauty or communities they wish to preserve.
  Within their dwellings, bronze dragons hoard things they believe will be useful one day. They salvage treasure
  lost to the sea, reclaiming wealth or sunken ships.
