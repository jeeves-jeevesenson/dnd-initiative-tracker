traits:
- name: Corpses
  desc: When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of {@dice 1d6 + 3} humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.
- name: Spider Climb
  desc: The corpse flower can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- name: Stench of Death
  desc: Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the corpse flower or one of its zombies must make a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw, unless the creature is a construct or undead. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition incapacitated} until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison damage or the {@condition poisoned} condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the stench of all corpse flowers for 24 hours.
