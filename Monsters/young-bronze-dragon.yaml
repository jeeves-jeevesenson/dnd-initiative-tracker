description: Where bronze dragons dwell, wonders flourish. Imaginative yet mindful, these metallic dragons work toward greatness
  and help others achieve all they can. They strive to preserve innovations, from the works of past civilizations to new discoveries,
  and they share such works widely. When dealing with shorter-lived beings, bronze dragons prefer to win them over through
  conversation and cultivation, but they don't shy from battle when villains keep others from achieving their potential. Bronze
  dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities of the sea, and they often make their lairs in places of natural beauty
  or communities they wish to preserve. Within their dwellings, bronze dragons hoard things they believe will be useful one
  day. They salvage treasure lost to the sea, reclaiming wealth or sunken ships.
