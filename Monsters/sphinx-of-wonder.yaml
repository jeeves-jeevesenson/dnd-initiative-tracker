description: A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time
  a unique idea is conceived on the Material Plane. Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular type of
  story or field of study, and it learns all it can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its forehead that

  and aids them in their research.
