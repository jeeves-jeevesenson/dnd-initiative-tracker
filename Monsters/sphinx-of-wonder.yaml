description: A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time a unique
  idea is conceived on the Material Plane. Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular type of story or field of study,
  and it learns all it can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its forehead that suggests the type of knowledge that
  fascinates it. Sometimes, a sphinx of wonder forms a bond with a mortal scholar and aids them in their research.
