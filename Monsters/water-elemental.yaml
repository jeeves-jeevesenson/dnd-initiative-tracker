description: ''
habitat: Coastal, Planar (Elemental Plane of Water), Swamp, Underwater
traits:
- name: Water Form
  desc: The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch
    wide without squeezing.
- name: Freeze
  desc: If the elemental takes cold damage, it partially freezes; its speed is reduced by 20 feet until the end of its next
    turn.
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  desc: The elemental makes two slam attacks.
- name: Slam
  desc: '{@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage.'
- name: Whelm {@recharge 4}
  desc: Each creature in the elemental's space must make a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13
    ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}).
    Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the
    saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the elemental's space. The elemental can grapple one Large creature
    or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental's turns, each target {@condition
    grappled} by it takes 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a
    creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a {@dc 14} Strength check and succeeding.
