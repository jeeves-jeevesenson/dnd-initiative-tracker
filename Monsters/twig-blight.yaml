description: Resembling bundles of sticks or dead brush, twig blights easily blend
  in among deadwood, flotsam, and the wood piles common in many rural settings. Groups
  of them are often found near river crossings, forgotten wells, or natural campsites,
  where they ambush those who let down their guard.
