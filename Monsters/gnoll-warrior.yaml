description: The first gnolls arose from hyenas that fed on flesh tainted by the Abyss. Their corruption and violence
  delighted the demon lord Yeenoghu, who encouraged their numbers and spread them across the multiverse. Ever since,
  gnolls have been the cackling servants of Yeenoghu, existing to cause ruin and to feast on what remains. Gnoll
  warriors crave endless slaughter but quickly grow bored with the prey they kill and the treasures they plunder.
  Nevertheless, they're enraged by the thought of anyone else having what's theirs, compelling them to despoil what
  they can't take with them.
