description: Silver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency
  while remaining watchful against evil. Silver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations
  and congeniality drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with
  artists, historians, knights, and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures. Silver dragons
  take inspiration from legendary heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests,
  such as histories, ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.
