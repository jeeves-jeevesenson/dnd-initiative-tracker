    description: You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid,
      Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and
      then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes
      3d8 damage of the chosen type. If you roll the same number on two or more of
      the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of
      the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage
      roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell
      slot. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each
      spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to
      the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by
      each casting of this spell.
