    description: You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time
      passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which
      you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions
      you use during this period, or any effects that you create during it, affects
      a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other
      than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000
      feet from the location where you cast it.
