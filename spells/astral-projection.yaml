    description: "You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your\
      \ astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already\
      \ on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended\
      \ animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and\
      \ doesn't age. A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way,\
      \ replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference\
      \ is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades\
      \ of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is\
      \ cut\u2014which happens only when an effect states that it does so\u2014the\
      \ target's body and astral form both die. A target's astral form can travel\
      \ through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the\
      \ target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target\
      \ to re-enter its body on the new plane. Any damage or other effects that apply\
      \ to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a\
      \ target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that\
      \ target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss\
      \ it. When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears\
      \ in its body and exits the state of suspended animation."
