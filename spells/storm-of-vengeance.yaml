    description: A churning storm cloud forms for the duration, centered on a point
      within range and spreading to a radius of 300 feet. Each creature under the
      cloud when it appears must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6
      Thunder damage and have the Deafened condition for the duration. At the start
      of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed
      below. Turn 2 . Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud
      takes 4d6 Acid damage. Turn 3 . You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud
      to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half
      as much damage on a successful one. Turn 4 . Hailstones rain down. Each creature
      under the cloud takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage. Turns 5-10 . Gusts and freezing
      rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes 1d6 Cold damage.
      Until the spell ends, the area is Difficult Terrain and Heavily Obscured, ranged
      attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the
      area.
