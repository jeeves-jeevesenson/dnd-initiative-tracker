    description: "Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the\
      \ direction to the creature's location if that creature is within 1,000 feet\
      \ of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\
      \ The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature\
      \ of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a\
      \ creature up close\u2014within 30 feet\u2014at least once. If the creature\
      \ you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of\
      \ a Flesh to Stone or Polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.\
      \ This spell can't locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct\
      \ path between you and the creature."
