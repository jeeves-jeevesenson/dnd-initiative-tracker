    description: 'You touch a willing creature and choose a damage type: Acid, Bludgeoning,
      Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Radiant, Slashing, or Thunder.
      When the creature takes damage of the chosen type before the spell ends, the
      creature reduces the total damage taken by 1d4. A creature can benefit from
      this spell only once per turn.'
