    description: You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years
      and that died for any reason except old age. The creature is revived with all
      its Hit Points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures
      all magical contagions, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it
      died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature
      was Undead, it is restored to its non-Undead form. The spell can provide a new
      body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's
      name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10
      feet of you.
