    description: You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within
      range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic
      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid
      killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a Zombie that follows
      your verbal orders.
