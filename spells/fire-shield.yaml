    description: Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding Bright
      Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames
      provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield
      grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance
      to Fire damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you
      with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8
      Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.
