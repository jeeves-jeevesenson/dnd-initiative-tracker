    description: You activate one of the effects below. Until the spell ends, you
      can activate either effect as a Magic action on your later turns. Sense Thoughts
      . You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong
      to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts,
      but you know that a thinking creature is present. The spell is blocked by 1
      foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead. Read
      Thoughts . Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one
      creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts
      option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target
      doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing. As a Magic
      action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind.
      If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
      you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large
      in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell
      ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until
      you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an
      action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell
      save DC, ending the spell on a success.
