    description: You touch a creature or at least 1 cubic inch of its flesh. An inert
      duplicate of that creature forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting
      and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the finished clone is
      the same age as the creature or younger. The clone remains inert and endures
      indefinitely while its vessel remains undisturbed. If the original creature
      dies after the clone finishes forming, the creature's soul transfers to the
      clone if the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical
      to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none
      of the original's equipment. The creature's original remains, if any, become
      inert and can't be revived, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.
