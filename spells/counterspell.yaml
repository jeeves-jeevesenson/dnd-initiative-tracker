    description: You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell.
      The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell
      dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to
      cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't
      expended.
