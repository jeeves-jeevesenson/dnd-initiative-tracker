    description: Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot Emanation.
      Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw.
      On a failed save, a target takes 5d6 Thunder damage and 5d6 Radiant or Necrotic
      damage (your choice) and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, a target
      takes half as much damage only.
