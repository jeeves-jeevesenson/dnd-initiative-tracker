    description: Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the
      duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or
      fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish. When you cast this
      spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's
      Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's
      space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the
      creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
      3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you
      are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature
      makes this save only once per turn. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage
      increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
