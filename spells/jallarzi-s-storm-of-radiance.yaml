    description: You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius,
      40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. While in
      this area, creatures have the Blinded and Deafened conditions, and they can't
      cast spells with a Verbal component. When the storm appears, each creature in
      it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 Radiant damage and 2d10 Thunder
      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature
      also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a
      turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
      Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by
      1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
