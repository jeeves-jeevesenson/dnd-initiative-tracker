      of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the
      object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes

      object is within range. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes
      the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
      or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has Disadvantage
      on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn. Using
      a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot
