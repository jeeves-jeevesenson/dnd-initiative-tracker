    description: "This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures\
      \ that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within\
      \ range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large\
      \ or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The\
      \ destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane\
      \ of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether\
      \ you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation\
      \ Outcome table and the explanations after it. Familiarity Mishap Similar Area\

      \ circle\u201D means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you\
      \ know. \u2022 \u201CLinked object\u201D means you possess an object taken from\
      \ the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a\
      \ wizard's library. \u2022 \u201CVery familiar\u201D is a place you have visited\
      \ often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you\
      \ cast the spell. \u2022 \u201CSeen casually\u201D is a place you have seen\
      \ more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \u2022 \u201CViewed\
      \ once or described\u201D is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic,\
      \ or a place you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\
      \ \u2022 \u201CFalse destination\u201D is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps\
      \ you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you\
      \ are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists. Mishap . The\
      \ spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting\
      \ creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls\
      \ on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing\
      \ damage each time). Similar Area . You and your group (or the target object)\
      \ appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the\
      \ target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for\
      \ your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory\
      \ in the same city. Off Target . You and your group (or the target object) appear\
      \ 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the\
      \ direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest;\
      \ 7, north; or 8, northeast. On Target . You and your group (or the target object)\
      \ appear where you intended."
