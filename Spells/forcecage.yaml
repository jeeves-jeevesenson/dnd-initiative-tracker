    description: An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
      springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can
      be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. A prison in the shape of a cage can
      be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2
      inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating
      a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking
      any spells cast into or out from the area. When you cast the spell, any creature
      that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially
      within the area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the
      center of the area until they are completely outside it. A creature inside the
      cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation
      or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a Charisma saving throw.
      On a successful save, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a
      failed save, the creature doesn't exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect.
      The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This
      spell can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic .
