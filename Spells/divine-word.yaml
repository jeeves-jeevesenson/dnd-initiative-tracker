    description: "You utter a word imbued with power from the Upper Planes. Each creature\
      \ of your choice in range makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a\
      \ target that has 50 Hit Points or fewer suffers an effect based on its current\
      \ Hit Points, as shown in the Divine Word Effects table. Regardless of its Hit\
      \ Points, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend target that fails its\
      \ save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and\
      \ can't return to the current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a Wish\
      \ spell. Hit Points Effect 0\u201320 The target dies. 21\u201330 The target\
      \ has the Blinded, Deafened, and Stunned conditions for 1 hour. 31\u201340 The\
      \ target has the Blinded and Deafened conditions for 10 minutes. 41\u201350\
      \ The target has the Deafened condition for 1 minute."
