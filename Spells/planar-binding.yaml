    description: You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend
      to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of
      the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the
      inverted version of the Magic Circle spell to trap it while this spell is cast.)
      At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving
      throw or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned
      or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the
      duration of this spell. A bound creature must follow your commands to the best
      of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure,
      to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it
      strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature
      carries out your commands completely before the spell ends, it travels to you
      to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on
      a different plane, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there
      until the spell ends. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The duration increases
      with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366
      days).
