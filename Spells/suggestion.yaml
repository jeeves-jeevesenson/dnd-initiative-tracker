    description: "You suggest a course of activity\u2014described in no more than\
      \ 25 words\u2014to one creature you can see within range that can hear and understand\
      \ you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would\
      \ obviously deal damage to the target or its allies. For example, you could\
      \ say, \u201CFetch the key to the cult's treasure vault, and give the key to\
      \ me.\u201D Or you could say, \u201CStop fighting, leave this library peacefully,\
      \ and don't return.\u201D The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or\
      \ have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal\
      \ damage to the target. The Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best\
      \ of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration,\
      \ but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell\
      \ ends for the target upon completing it."
