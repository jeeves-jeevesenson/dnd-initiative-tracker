    description: You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object
      is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how
      to use them, whether it requires Attunement, and how many charges it has, if
      any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they
      are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name. If you
      instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells,
      if any, are currently affecting it.
