    description: You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that
      you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
      and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. You can give the same appearance
      or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the
      targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter
      or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have
      the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion
      is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration. The changes wrought
      by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use
      this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.
      A creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes
      aware that the target is disguised.
