    description: You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can
      see within range. The hound remains for the duration or until the two of you
      are more than 300 feet apart from each other. No one but you can see the hound,
      and it is intangible and invulnerable. When a Small or larger creature comes
      within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when
      you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound has Truesight
      with a range of 30 feet. At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts
      to bite one enemy within 5 feet of it. That enemy must succeed on a Dexterity
      saving throw or take 4d8 Force damage. On your later turns, you can take a Magic
      action to move the hound up to 30 feet.
