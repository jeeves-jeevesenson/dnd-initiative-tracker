    description: A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
      Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills
      the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder
      up to 60 feet. When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if
      the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example),
      it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder.
      On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature
      also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it
      enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only
      once per turn. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d10
      for each spell slot level above 2.
