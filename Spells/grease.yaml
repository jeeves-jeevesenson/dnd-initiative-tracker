    description: Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered
      on a point within range and turns it into Difficult Terrain for the duration.
      When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on
      a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. A creature that enters
      the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall Prone.
