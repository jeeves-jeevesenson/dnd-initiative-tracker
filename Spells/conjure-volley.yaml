    description: You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and choose a point
      within range. Hundreds of similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate
      to the weapon) fall in a volley and then disappear. Each creature of your choice
      that you can see in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high Cylinder centered on that
      point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 Force damage on a
      failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
