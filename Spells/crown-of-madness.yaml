    description: One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom
      saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The creature succeeds
      automatically if it isn't Humanoid. A spectral crown appears on the Charmed
      target's head, and it must use its action before moving on each of its turns
      to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally
      choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or
      if no creature is within its reach. The target repeats the save at the end of
      each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success. On your later turns,
      you must take the Magic action to maintain control of the target, or the spell
      ends.
