    description: An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you
      choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal
      or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a
      solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius
      of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot
      panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall
      is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's
      space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose
      which side). Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all
      damage and can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic . A Disintegrate spell destroys
      the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and
      blocks ethereal travel through the wall.
