    description: One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma
      saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While
      there, the target has the Incapacitated condition. When the spell ends, the
      target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if
      that space is occupied. If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental,
      a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute.
      The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice)
      associated with its creature type. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . You can
      target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
