  raw:
    description: Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings
      to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing,
      as described by the DM. The lore might consist of important details, amusing
      revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more
      information you already know about the thing, the more precise and detailed
      the information you receive is. That information is accurate but might be couched
      in figurative language or poetry, as determined by the DM. If the famous thing
      you chose isn't actually famous, you hear sad musical notes played on a trombone,
      and the spell fails.
