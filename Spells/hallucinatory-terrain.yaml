    description: You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound,
      and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road
      can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or
      impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice
      like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured
      structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed. The tactile
      characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area
      are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch,
      a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature
      discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed
      on the real terrain.
