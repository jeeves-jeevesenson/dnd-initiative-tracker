    description: You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The
      webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain,
      and the area within them is Lightly Obscured. If the webs aren't anchored between
      two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or
      ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your
      next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. The first
      time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must
      succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while in
      the webs or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained by the webs can take
      an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If
      it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot
      Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage
      to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
