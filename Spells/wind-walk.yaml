    description: You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume
      gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud
      form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to
      the Prone condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
      damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the Dash action
      or a Magic action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute,
      during which the target has the Stunned condition. Until the spell ends, the
      target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action followed
      by a 1-minute transformation. If a target is in cloud form and flying when the
      effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands,
      which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining
      distance.
