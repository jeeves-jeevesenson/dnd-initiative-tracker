    description: You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar
      to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that
      is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove
      of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.
      When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense
      through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch
      between seeing and hearing. A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature
      benefiting from See Invisibility or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the
      size of your fist.
