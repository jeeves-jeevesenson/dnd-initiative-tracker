    description: Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you
      can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that
      area into Difficult Terrain. Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving
      throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained
      condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters
      the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.
      A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check
      against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
