    description: You create a wall of whirling blades made of magical energy. The
      wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You make a straight wall
      up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to
      60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides Three-Quarters
      Cover, and its space is Difficult Terrain. Any creature in the wall's space
      makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or
      half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes that save if
      it enters the wall's space or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save
      only once per turn.
