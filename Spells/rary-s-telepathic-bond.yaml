    description: You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of
      your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others
      for the duration. Creatures that can't communicate in any languages aren't affected
      by this spell. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically
      through the bond whether or not they share a language. The communication is
      possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.
