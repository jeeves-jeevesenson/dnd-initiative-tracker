    description: You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied
      space that you can see within range and uses the Aberrant Spirit stat block.
      When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin, Mind Flayer, or Slaad. The creature
      resembles an Aberration of that kind, which determines certain details in its
      stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the
      spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares
      your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys
      your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it
      takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
