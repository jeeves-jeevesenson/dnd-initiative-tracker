      Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
      a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On
      a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. In addition, unsecured
      objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you,
      and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet. Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.
