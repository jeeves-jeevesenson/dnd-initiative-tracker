    description: You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can
      make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed
      wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is
      opaque and lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature in its
      area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save
      or half as much damage on a successful one. One side of the wall, selected by
      you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends
      its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the
      same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
      turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
