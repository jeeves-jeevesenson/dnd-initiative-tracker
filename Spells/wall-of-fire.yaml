      wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is

      its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the
      same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
      turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
