    description: As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes
      a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on this save.
      On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends.
      On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends. While Restrained,
      the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The
      target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength
      (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.
      Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell
      slot level above 1.
