    description: "You magically sense the most direct physical route to a location\
      \ you name. You must be familiar with the location, and the spell fails if you\
      \ name a destination on another plane of existence, a moving destination (such\
      \ as a mobile fortress), or an unspecific destination (such as \u201Ca green\
      \ dragon's lair\u201D). For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane\
      \ of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction\
      \ it lies. Whenever you face a choice of paths along the way there, you know\
      \ which path is the most direct."
