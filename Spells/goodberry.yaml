    description: Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the
      duration. A creature can take a Bonus Action to eat one berry. Eating a berry
      restores 1 Hit Point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a
      creature for one day. Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
