    description: You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range.
      If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise,
      its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn. The Stunned target makes a
      Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition
      on itself on a success.
