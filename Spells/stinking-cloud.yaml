    description: You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered
      on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in
      the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by
      Gust of Wind ) disperses it. Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere
      must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until
      the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can't
      take an action or a Bonus Action.
