    description: "With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no\
      \ longer than 10 days and it wasn't Undead when it died. The creature returns\
      \ to life with 1 Hit Point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected\
      \ the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds, but\
      \ it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts\
      \ or organs integral for its survival\u2014its head, for instance\u2014the spell\
      \ automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes\
      \ a \u22124 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest,\
      \ the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0."
