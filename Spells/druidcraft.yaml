    description: Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following
      effects within range. Weather Sensor . You create a Tiny, harmless sensory effect
      that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours.
      The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain,
      falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. Bloom
      . You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
      Sensory Effect . You create a harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves,
      spectral dancing fairies, a gentle breeze, the sound of an animal, or the faint
      odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot Cube. Fire Play . You light or
      snuff out a candle, a torch, or a campfire.
