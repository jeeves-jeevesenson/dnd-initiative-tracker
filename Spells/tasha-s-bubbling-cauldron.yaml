    description: You conjure a claw-footed cauldron filled with bubbling liquid. The
      cauldron appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you and
      lasts for the duration. The cauldron can't be moved, and disappears when the
      spell ends, along with the bubbling liquid inside of it. The liquid in the cauldron
      duplicates the properties of a Common or an Uncommon potion of your choice (such
      as potion of healing ). As a Bonus Action, you or an ally can reach into the
      cauldron and withdraw one potion of that kind. The potion is contained in a
      vial that disappears when the potion is consumed. The cauldron can produce a
      number of these potions equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum
      1). When the last of these potions is withdrawn from the cauldron, the cauldron
      disappears, and the spell ends. Potions obtained from the cauldron that aren't
      consumed disappear when you cast the spell again.
