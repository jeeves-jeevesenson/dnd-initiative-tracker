    description: A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above
      yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot
      radius. When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud.
      A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5
      feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage
      on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Until the spell
      ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that way again,
      targeting the same point or a different one. If you're outdoors in a storm when
      you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of
      creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.
      Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell
      slot level above 3.
