    description: You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike
      like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a
      melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 Force
      damage. You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of
      one of the targets.
