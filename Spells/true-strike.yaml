    description: Guided by a flash of magical insight, you make one attack with the
      weapon used in the spell's casting. The attack uses your spellcasting ability
      for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the
      attack deals damage, it can be Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage
      type (your choice). Cantrip Upgrade . Whether you deal Radiant damage or the
      weapon's normal damage type, the attack deals extra Radiant damage when you
      reach levels 5 (1d6), 11 (2d6), and 17 (3d6).
