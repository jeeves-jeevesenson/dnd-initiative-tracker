    description: For the duration, you sense the location of any Aberration, Celestial,
      Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead within 30 feet of yourself. You also sense
      whether the Hallow spell is active there and, if so, where. The spell is blocked
      by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.
