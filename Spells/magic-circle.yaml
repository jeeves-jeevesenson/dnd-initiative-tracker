    description: "You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy\
      \ centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes\
      \ appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose\
      \ one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey,\
      \ Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the\
      \ following ways: \u2022 The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by\
      \ nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar\
      \ travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. \u2022\
      \ The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.\
      \ \u2022 Targets within the Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed\
      \ or Frightened condition from the creature. Each time you cast this spell,\
      \ you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a\
      \ creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets\
      \ outside it. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The duration increases by 1\
      \ hour for each spell slot level above 3."
