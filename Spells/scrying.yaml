    description: "You can see and hear a creature you choose that is on the same plane\
      \ of existence as you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified\
      \ (see the tables below) by how well you know the target and the sort of physical\
      \ connection you have to it. The target doesn't know what it is making the save\
      \ against, only that it feels uneasy. Your Knowledge of the Target Is... Save\

      \ part, lock of hair, or bit of nail \u221210 On a successful save, the target\
      \ isn't affected, and you can't use this spell on it again for 24 hours. On\
      \ a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible, intangible sensor within 10\
      \ feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were\
      \ there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for\
      \ the duration. If something can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb\
      \ about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can target\
      \ a location you have seen. When you do so, the sensor appears at that location\
      \ and doesn't move."
