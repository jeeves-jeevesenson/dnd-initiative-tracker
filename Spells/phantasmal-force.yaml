    description: You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can
      see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
      save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is
      no larger than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for
      the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli. The
      target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the
      target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While
      affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and
      rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if
      the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes
      the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall. An affected target can
      even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature
      or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage
      to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm.
      The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.
