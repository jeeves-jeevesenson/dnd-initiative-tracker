    description: You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns.
      The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration.
      You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick
      or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet
      thick. The wall blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in
      its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed
      save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can move through
      the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through
      the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature
      enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes
      a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half
      as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per
      turn. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Both types of damage increase by 1d8
      for each spell slot level above 6.
