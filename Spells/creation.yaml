    description: You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an
      object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods,
      rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the
      like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must
      be of a form and material that you have seen. The spell's duration depends on
      the object's material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed
      of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by
      this spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to fail.

      metals 1 hour Gems 10 minutes Adamantine or mithral 1 minute Using a Higher-Level
