    description: You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature
      you can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8
      Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
      On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell
      ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While
      you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it
      has the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against
      you. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each
      spell slot level above 2.
