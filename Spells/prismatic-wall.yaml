    description: "A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque\
      \ wall\u2014up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick\u2014centered\
      \ on a point within range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up\
      \ to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for\
      \ the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature,\
      \ the spell ends instantly without effect. The wall sheds Bright Light within\
      \ 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate\
      \ when you cast the spell can pass through and be near the wall without harm.\
      \ If another creature that can see the wall moves within 20 feet of it or starts\
      \ its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or\
      \ have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers,\
      \ each with a different color. When a creature reaches into or passes through\
      \ the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the layers. Each layer\
      \ forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that\
      \ layer's properties as described in the Prismatic Layers table. The wall, which\
      \ has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from red to violet,\
      \ by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the\
      \ duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic can\
      \ affect only the violet layer. Order Effects 1 Red . Failed Save : 12d6 Fire\
      \ damage. Successful Save : Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Nonmagical\
      \ ranged attacks can't pass through this layer, which is destroyed if it takes\
      \ at least 25 Cold damage. 2 Orange . Failed Save : 12d6 Acid damage. Successful\
      \ Save : Half as much damage. Additional Effects: Magical ranged attacks can't\
      \ pass through this layer, which is destroyed by a strong wind (such as the\
      \ one created by Gust of Wind ). 3 Yellow . Failed Save : 12d6 Lightning damage.\
      \ Successful Save : Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed\
      \ if it takes at least 60 Force damage. 4 Green . Failed Save : 12d6 Poison\
      \ damage. Successful Save : Half as much damage. Additional Effects: A Passwall\
      \ spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on\
      \ a solid surface, destroys this layer. 5 Blue . Failed Save : 12d6 Cold damage.\
      \ Successful Save : Half as much damage. Additional Effects: The layer is destroyed\
      \ if it takes at least 25 Fire damage. 6 Indigo . Failed Save : The target has\
      \ the Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end\
      \ of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition\
      \ ends. If it fails three times, it has the Petrified condition until it is\
      \ freed by an effect like the Greater Restoration spell. The successes and failures\
      \ needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three\
      \ of a kind. Additional Effects: Spells can't be cast through this layer, which\
      \ is destroyed by Bright Light shed by the Daylight spell. 7 Violet . Failed\
      \ Save : The target has the Blinded condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw\
      \ at the start of your next turn. On a Successful Save , the condition ends.\
      \ On a Failed Save , the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another\
      \ plane of existence (DM's choice). Additional Effects: This layer is destroyed\
      \ by Dispel Magic ."
