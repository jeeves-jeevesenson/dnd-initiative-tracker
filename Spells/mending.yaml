    description: This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch,
      such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a
      leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any
      dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can
      physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.
