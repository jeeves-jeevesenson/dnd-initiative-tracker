    description: You launch a lightning bolt toward a target you can see within range.
      Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of
      your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target
      can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.
      Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Lightning damage on
      a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . One additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target
      for each spell slot level above 6.
