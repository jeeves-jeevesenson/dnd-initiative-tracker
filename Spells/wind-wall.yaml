    description: A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose
      within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1
      foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes
      one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. When
      the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking
      4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one. The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller
      flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight
      materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary
      projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and miss
      automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles,
      are unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.
