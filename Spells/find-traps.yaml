    description: You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap,
      for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created
      to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the Alarm or Glyph
      of Warding spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural
      weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole. This spell
      reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general
      nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
