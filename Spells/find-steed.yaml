    description: You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in
      an unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the Otherworldly
      Steed stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is
      replaced by the new one. The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your
      choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast
      the spell, choose the steed's creature type—Celestial, Fey, or Fiend—which determines
      certain traits in the stat block. Combat . The steed is an ally to you and your
      allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, and it functions as a controlled
      mount while you ride it (as defined in the rules on mounted combat). If you
      have the Incapacitated condition, the steed takes its turn immediately after
      yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you. Disappearance of the
      Steed . The steed disappears if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if you die. When
      it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If you
      cast this spell again, you decide whether you summon the steed that disappeared
      or a different one. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Use the spell slot's level
      for the spell's level in the stat block.
