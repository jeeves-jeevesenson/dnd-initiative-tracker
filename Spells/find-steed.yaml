    description: "You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in\
      \ an unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the Otherworldly\
      \ Steed stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is\
      \ replaced by the new one. The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your\
      \ choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast\
      \ the spell, choose the steed's creature type\u2014Celestial, Fey, or Fiend\u2014\
      which determines certain traits in the stat block. Combat . The steed is an\
      \ ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, and\
      \ it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it (as defined in the rules\
      \ on mounted combat). If you have the Incapacitated condition, the steed takes\
      \ its turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting\
      \ you. Disappearance of the Steed . The steed disappears if it drops to 0 Hit\
      \ Points or if you die. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was\
      \ wearing or carrying. If you cast this spell again, you decide whether you\
      \ summon the steed that disappeared or a different one. Using a Higher-Level\
      \ Spell Slot . Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat\
      \ block."
