    description: "With a touch, you revive a dead creature that has been dead for\
      \ no more than a century, didn't die of old age, and wasn't Undead when it died.\
      \ The creature returns to life with all its Hit Points. This spell also neutralizes\
      \ any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes\
      \ all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Coming back from the\
      \ dead is an ordeal. The target takes a \u22124 penalty to D20 Tests. Every\
      \ time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it\
      \ becomes 0. Casting this spell to revive a creature that has been dead for\
      \ 365 days or longer taxes you. Until you finish a Long Rest, you can't cast\
      \ spells again, and you have Disadvantage on D20 Tests."
