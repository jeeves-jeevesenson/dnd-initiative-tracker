    description: 'You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal
      form you choose: Bat , Cat , Frog , Hawk , Lizard , Octopus , Owl , Rat , Raven
      , Spider , Weasel , or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing
      in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the
      chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of
      a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.
      Telepathic Connection . While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can
      communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can
      see through the familiar''s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your
      next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. Finally, when
      you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch.
      Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to
      deliver the touch when you cast the spell. Combat . The familiar is an ally
      to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn.
      A familiar can''t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. Disappearance
      of the Familiar . When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It
      reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily
      dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it
      forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause
      it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar
      drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind
      in its space anything it was wearing or carrying. One Familiar Only . You can''t
      have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have
      a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.'
