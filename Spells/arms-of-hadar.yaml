    description: Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature
      in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On
      a failed save, a target takes 2d6 Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until
      the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much
      damage only. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d6 for
      each spell slot level above 1.
