    description: You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
      that you can see within range and uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. The creature
      disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends. The creature
      is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative
      count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands
      (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action
      and uses its movement to avoid danger. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Use
      the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
