    description: An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration.
      While in the aura, you and your allies have Advantage on saving throws against
      spells and other magical effects. When an affected creature makes a saving throw
      against a spell or magical effect that allows a save to take only half damage,
      it takes no damage if it succeeds on the save.
