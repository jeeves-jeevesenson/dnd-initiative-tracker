    description: You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature
      in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
      takes 6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your
      next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. Until the
      spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance. For
      the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright
      Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light
      is sunlight.
