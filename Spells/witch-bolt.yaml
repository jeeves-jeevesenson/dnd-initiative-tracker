      forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged
      spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 Lightning damage. On
      each of your subsequent turns, you can take a Bonus Action to deal 1d12 Lightning
      damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed. The spell
      ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total Cover
      from you. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The initial damage increases by
      1d12 for each spell slot level above 1.
