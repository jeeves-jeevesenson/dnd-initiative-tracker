    description: "Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the\
      \ direction to the object's location if that object is within 1,000 feet of\
      \ you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. The\
      \ spell can locate a specific object known to you if you have seen it up close\u2014\
      within 30 feet\u2014at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest\
      \ object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture,\
      \ tool, or weapon. This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead\
      \ blocks a direct path between you and the object."
