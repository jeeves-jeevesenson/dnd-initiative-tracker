      is indistinguishable from death. For the duration, the target appears dead to
      outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The
      target has the Blinded and Incapacitated conditions, and its Speed is 0. The
      target also has Resistance to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has Immunity
      to the Poisoned condition.
