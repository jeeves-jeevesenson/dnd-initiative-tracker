      The first time the target would drop to 0 Hit Points before the spell ends,
      the target instead drops to 1 Hit Point, and the spell ends. If the spell is
      still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it
      instantly without dealing damage, that effect is negated against the target,
      and the spell ends.
