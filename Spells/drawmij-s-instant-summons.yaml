    description: You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing
      10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves
      an Invisible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object's name on
      the sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
      Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak the object's name and crush
      the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical
      or planar distances, and the spell ends. If another creature is holding or carrying
      the object, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport it, but instead you learn
      who that creature is and where that creature is currently located.
