      that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration. Make a melee
      spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target

      within 30 feet of the vine. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The number of
      creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above
