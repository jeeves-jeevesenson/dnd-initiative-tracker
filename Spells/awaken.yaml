    description: You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious
      gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant
      creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature.
      The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language
      you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and
      gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and
      it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate
      for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the Awakened Shrub or Awakened
      Tree . The awakened target has the Charmed condition for 30 days or until you
      or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature
      chooses its attitude toward you.
