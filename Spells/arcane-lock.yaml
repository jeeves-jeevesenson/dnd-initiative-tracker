    description: You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically
      lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means.
      You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close
      the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within
      5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.
