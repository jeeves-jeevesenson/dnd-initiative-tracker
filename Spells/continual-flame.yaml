    description: A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts Bright
      Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. It looks
      like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame
      can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
