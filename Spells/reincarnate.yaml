    description: You touch a dead Humanoid or a piece of one. If the creature has
      been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new body for it and calls
      the soul to enter that body. Roll 1d10 and consult the table below to determine
      the body's species, or the DM chooses another playable species. 1d10 Species
      1 Aasimar 2 Dragonborn 3 Dwarf 4 Elf 5 Gnome 6 Goliath 7 Halfling 8 Human 9
      Orc 10 Tiefling The reincarnated creature makes any choices that a species'
      description offers, and the creature recalls its former life. It retains the
      capabilities it had in its original form, except it loses the traits of its
      previous species and gains the traits of its new one.
