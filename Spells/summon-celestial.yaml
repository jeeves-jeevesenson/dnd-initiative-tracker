    description: You call forth a Celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form
      in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Celestial
      Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender. Your
      choice determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears
      when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally
      to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count,
      but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands
      (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action
      and uses its movement to avoid danger. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Use
      the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
