    description: This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high Cylinder
      centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area that
      aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder.
      A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach,
      thus avoiding the fall upward. If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered
      in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during
      a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder's top
      without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell
      ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
