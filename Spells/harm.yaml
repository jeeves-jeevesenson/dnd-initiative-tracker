    description: You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range.
      The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6
      Necrotic damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
      the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage
      only. This spell can't reduce a target's Hit Point maximum below 1.
