    description: "You suggest a course of activity\u2014described in no more than\
      \ 25 words\u2014to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can\
      \ hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve\
      \ anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies.\
      \ For example, you could say, \u201CWalk to the village down that road, and\
      \ help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset.\u201D Or you could say,\
      \ \u201CNow is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop\
      \ in an hour.\u201D Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have\
      \ the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage\
      \ to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its\
      \ ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but\
      \ if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends\
      \ for a target upon completing it. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The duration\
      \ is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days)."
