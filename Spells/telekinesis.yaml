    description: You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by
      thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on your later turns before
      the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can
      see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same
      target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets,
      the prior target is no longer affected by the spell. Creature . You can try
      to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving
      throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.
      Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition,
      and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end
      of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save.
      Object . You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being
      worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within
      the spell's range. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature
      must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and move
      it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. You can exert fine
      control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple
      tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open
      container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
