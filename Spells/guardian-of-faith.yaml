    description: A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in
      an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that
      space and is invulnerable, and it appears in a form appropriate for your deity
      or pantheon. Any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian
      for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Dexterity saving
      throw, taking 20 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
      successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.
