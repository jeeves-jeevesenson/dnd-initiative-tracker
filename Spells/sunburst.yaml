    description: Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere centered on
      a point you choose within range. Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 Radiant damage and has
      the Blinded condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much
      damage only. A creature Blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      This spell dispels Darkness in its area that was created by any spell.
