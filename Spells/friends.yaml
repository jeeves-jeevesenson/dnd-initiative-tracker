    description: You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one creature you
      can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have
      the Charmed condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if
      it isn't a Humanoid, if you're fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on
      it within the past 24 hours. The spell ends early if the target takes damage
      or if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or force anyone to make a saving
      throw. When the spell ends, the target knows it was Charmed by you.
