    description: The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from
      others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within
      reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain Hit Points
      equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you
      can make the attack again on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting
      the same creature or a different one. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The
      damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.
