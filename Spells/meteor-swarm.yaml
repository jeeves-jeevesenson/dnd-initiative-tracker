    description: Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points
      you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered
      on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6
      Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage
      on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is
      affected only once. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also
      takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts burning
      if it's flammable.
