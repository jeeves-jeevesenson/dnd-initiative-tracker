    description: 'You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following
      effects within range: Beckon Air . You create a breeze strong enough to ripple
      cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a
      5-foot Cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren''t
      affected. Beckon Earth . You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers
      surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your
      handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand. Beckon Fire . You create a thin cloud
      of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot Cube. You choose the
      color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that
      area. The smoke''s scent lingers for 1 minute. Beckon Water . You create a spray
      of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot Cube. Alternatively,
      you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface,
      and the water evaporates in 1 minute. Sculpt Element . You cause dirt, sand,
      fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot Cube to assume a crude
      shape (such as that of a creature or an object) for 1 hour.'
