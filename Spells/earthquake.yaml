    description: Choose a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the
      duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle
      centered on that point. The ground there is Difficult Terrain. When you cast
      this spell and at the end of each of your turns for the duration, each creature
      on the ground in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
      a creature has the Prone condition, and its Concentration is broken. You can
      also cause the effects below. Fissures . A total of 1d6 fissures open in the
      spell's area at the end of the turn you cast it. You choose the fissures' locations,
      which can't be under structures. Each fissure is 1d10 x 10 feet deep and 10
      feet wide, and it extends from one edge of the spell's area to another edge.
      A creature in the same space as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving
      throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's
      edge as it opens. Structures . The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any
      structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and
      at the end of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops
      to 0 Hit Points, it collapses. A creature within a distance from a collapsing
      structure equal to half the structure's height makes a Dexterity saving throw.
      On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the Prone
      condition, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
      check as an action to escape. On a successful save, the creature takes half
      as much damage only.
