    description: "You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your\
      \ choice that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature\
      \ you or your companions are fighting automatically succeeds on this save. On\
      \ a failed save, a target has a \u221210 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks\
      \ and Passive Perception until the spell ends."
