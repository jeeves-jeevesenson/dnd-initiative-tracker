    description: You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
      that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the
      spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Divine beings aren't
      necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question
      pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where
      a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests,
      the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead. If you cast the spell
      more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
      chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
