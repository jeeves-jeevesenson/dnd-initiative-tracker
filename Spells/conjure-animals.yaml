    description: You conjure nature spirits that appear as a Large pack of spectral,
      intangible animals in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The pack
      lasts for the duration, and you choose the spirits' animal form, such as wolves,
      serpents, or birds. You have Advantage on Strength saving throws while you're
      within 5 feet of the pack, and when you move on your turn, you can also move
      the pack up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Whenever the pack
      moves within 10 feet of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can
      see enters a space within 10 feet of the pack or ends its turn there, you can
      force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 3d10 Slashing damage. A creature makes this save only once per
      turn. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d10 for each
      spell slot level above 3.
