    description: "With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature.\
      \ For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can't be targeted\
      \ by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic. If\
      \ the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has\
      \ the Unconscious condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.\
      \ You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything\
      \ you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples\
      \ include \u201Cafter 1,000 years\u201D or \u201Cwhen the tarrasque awakens.\u201D\
      \ This spell also ends if the target takes any damage."
