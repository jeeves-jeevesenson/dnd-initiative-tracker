    description: "You implant a message within an object in range\u2014a message that\
      \ is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can\
      \ see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the\
      \ message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over\
      \ as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger\
      \ the spell to deliver your message. When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth\
      \ appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same\
      \ volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks\
      \ like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears\
      \ there, so the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast\
      \ this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it\
      \ can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs. The trigger\
      \ can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual\
      \ or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example,\
      \ you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet\
      \ of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it."
