    description: You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point
      within range. Each creature in that area takes 4d4 Slashing damage. A creature
      also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the
      Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.
      On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to teleport the Cube up to
      30 feet. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 2d4 for each
      spell slot level above 2.
