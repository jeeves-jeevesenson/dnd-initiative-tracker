    description: One Beast you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target has Advantage
      on the save if you or your allies are fighting it. Whenever the target takes
      damage, it repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success. You have
      a telepathic link with the Charmed target while the two of you are on the same
      plane of existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to
      the target (no action required), such as "Attack that creature," "Move over
      there," or "Fetch that object." The target does its best to obey on its turn.
      If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it
      acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself. You can command the
      target to take a Reaction but must take your own Reaction to do so. Using a
      Higher-Level Spell Slot . Your Concentration can last longer with a spell slot
      of level 5 (up to 10 minutes), 6 (up to 1 hour), or 7+ (up to 8 hours).
