    description: "You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw\
      \ or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers\
      \ one of the following effects of your choice: \u2022 Choose one ability. The\
      \ target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that\
      \ ability. \u2022 The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. \u2022\
      \ In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of\
      \ each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn. \u2022\
      \ If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target\
      \ takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . If you\
      \ cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration\
      \ on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't\
      \ require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or\
      \ 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts\
      \ until dispelled."
