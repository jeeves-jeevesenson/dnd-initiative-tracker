    description: For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within
      30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action
      to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears
      the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's school
      of magic. The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of
      metal; or a thin sheet of lead.
