    description: When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action until it ends, you
      can make two attacks with a weapon that fires Arrows or Bolts, such as a Longbow
      or a Light Crossbow. The spell magically creates the ammunition needed for each
      attack. Each Arrow or Bolt created by the spell deals damage like a nonmagical
      piece of ammunition of its kind and disintegrates immediately after it hits
      or misses.
