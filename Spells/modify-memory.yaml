    description: You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature
      that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting
      the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has
      the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target
      also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though
      it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this
      spell ends, and no memories are modified. While this charm lasts, you can affect
      the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours
      and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory
      of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change
      its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other event. You
      must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must
      be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.
      Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell
      ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature's memory
      isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
      A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly
      if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or
      beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the
      creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might
      deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature. A Remove Curse
      or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true
      memory. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . You can alter the target's memories
      of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago
      (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the
      creature's past (level 9 spell slot).
