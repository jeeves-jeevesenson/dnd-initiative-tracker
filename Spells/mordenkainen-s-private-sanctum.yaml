    description: "You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube\
      \ that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell\
      \ lasts for the duration. When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security\
      \ the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties: \u2022 Sound\
      \ can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. \u2022 The\
      \ barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including\
      \ Dark vision) through it. \u2022 Sensors created by Divination spells can't\
      \ appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\
      \ \u2022 Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells. \u2022\
      \ Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. \u2022 Planar travel\
      \ is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every\
      \ day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled. Using a Higher-Level\
      \ Spell Slot . You can increase the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell\
      \ slot level above 4."
