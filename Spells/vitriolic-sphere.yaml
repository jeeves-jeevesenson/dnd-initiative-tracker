    description: You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter
      ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature
      in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
      10d4 Acid damage and another 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On
      a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The initial damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above
      4.
