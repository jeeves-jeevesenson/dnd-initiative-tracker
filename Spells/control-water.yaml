    description: Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose
      that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects.
      As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose
      a different one. Flood . You cause the water level of all standing water in
      the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body
      of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side
      of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the
      wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
      struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains
      elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect
      produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood
      effect lasts. Part Water . You part water in the area and create a trench. The
      trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall
      to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different
      effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next
      round until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow . You cause flowing
      water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to
      flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in
      the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area,
      it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the
      direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool
      . You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at
      least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose
      a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base,
      up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and
      within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature
      enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it
      makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning
      damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature
      can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away
      and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.
