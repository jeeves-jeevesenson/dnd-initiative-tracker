    description: You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The
      target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that
      only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are
      familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence;
      1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
