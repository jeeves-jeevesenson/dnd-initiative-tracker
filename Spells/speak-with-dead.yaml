    description: You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your choice within
      range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth,
      and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell
      also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.
      Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse
      knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are
      usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion
      to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes
      you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body,
      only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't
      comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about
      future events.
