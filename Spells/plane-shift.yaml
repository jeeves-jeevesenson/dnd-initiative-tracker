    description: You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle
      are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target
      destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane
      of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and
      you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the DM. Alternatively,
      if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of
      existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle
      is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest
      unoccupied spaces next to the circle.
