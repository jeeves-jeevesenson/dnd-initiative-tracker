      \ choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target\
      \ can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each\
      \ of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table\
      \ below. 1d10 Behavior for the Turn 1 The target doesn't take an action, and\
      \ it uses all its movement to move. Roll 1d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2,\
      \ east; 3, south; or 4, west. 2\u20136 The target doesn't move or take actions.\
      \ 7\u20138 The target doesn't move, and it takes the Attack action to make one\
      \ melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach,\
      \ the target takes no action. 9\u201310 The target chooses its behavior. At\
      \ the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending\
      \ the spell on itself on a success. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The Sphere's\
      \ radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4."
