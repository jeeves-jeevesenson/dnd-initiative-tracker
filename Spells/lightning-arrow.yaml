    description: As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition
      you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage
      or other effects from the attack, the target takes 4d8 Lightning damage on a
      hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target
      then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Lightning damage on a failed
      save or half as much damage on a successful one. The weapon or ammunition then
      returns to its normal form. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage for
      both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
