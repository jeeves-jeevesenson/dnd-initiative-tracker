    description: "You commune with nature spirits and gain knowledge of the surrounding\
      \ area. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the area within 3\
      \ miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius\
      \ is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced\
      \ by construction, such as in castles and settlements. Choose three of the following\
      \ facts; you learn those facts as they pertain to the spell's area: \u2022 Locations\
      \ of settlements \u2022 Locations of portals to other planes of existence \u2022\
      \ Location of one Challenge Rating 10+ creature (DM's choice) that is a Celestial,\
      \ an Elemental, a Fey, a Fiend, or an Undead \u2022 The most prevalent kind\
      \ of plant, mineral, or Beast (you choose which to learn) \u2022 Locations of\
      \ bodies of water For example, you could determine the location of a powerful\
