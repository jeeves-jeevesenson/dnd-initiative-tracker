    description: A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within
      range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area
      makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or
      half as much damage on a successful one. If the globe strikes a body of water,
      it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This
      ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen
      water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature
      can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
      DC to break free. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the
      spell's casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool
      to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give
      the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling
      (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as
      a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering
      it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes. Using
      a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot
      level above 6.
