    description: This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use
      determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.
      Overgrowth . Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius
      Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving
      through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You
      can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being
      affected. Enrichment . All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point
      within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal
      amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one Plant Growth per
      year.
