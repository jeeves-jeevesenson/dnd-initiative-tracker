    description: A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each
      creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving
      throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
      a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save. A nonmagical object
      that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's
      area. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each
      spell slot level above 2.
