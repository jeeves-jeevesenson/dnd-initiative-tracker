    description: "You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor\
      \ space. The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and you shape it as one\
      \ 50-foot square, one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or twenty-five\
      \ 10-foot squares that are contiguous. When you cast this spell, you can specify\
      \ individuals that are unaffected by the spell's effects. You can also specify\
      \ a password that, when spoken aloud within 5 feet of the warded area, makes\
      \ the speaker immune to its effects. The spell creates the effects below within\
      \ the warded area. Dispel Magic has no effect on Guards and Wards itself, but\
      \ each of the following effects can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled,\
      \ Guards and Wards ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365 days on the\
      \ same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects are dispelled.\
      \ Corridors . Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them Heavily Obscured.\
      \ In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of\
      \ direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you believes\
      \ it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses. Doors . All\
      \ doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by the Arcane\
      \ Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion to\
      \ make them appear as plain sections of wall. Stairs . Webs fill all stairs\
      \ in the warded area from top to bottom, as in the Web spell. These strands\
      \ regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while Guards and Wards lasts. Other\
      \ Spell Effect . Place one of the following magical effects within the warded\
      \ area: \u2022 Dancing Lights in four corridors, with a simple program that\
      \ the lights repeat as long as Guards and Wards lasts \u2022 Magic Mouth in\
      \ two locations \u2022 Stinking Cloud in two locations (the vapors return within\
      \ 10 minutes if dispersed while Guards and Wards lasts) \u2022 Gust of Wind\
      \ in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while the spell lasts)\
      \ \u2022 Suggestion in one 5-foot square; any creature that enters that square\
      \ receives the suggestion mentally"
