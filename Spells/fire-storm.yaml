    description: A storm of fire appears within range. The area of the storm consists
      of up to ten 10-foot Cubes, which you arrange as you like. Each Cube must be
      contiguous with at least one other Cube. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 7d10 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage
      on a successful one. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or
      carried start burning.
