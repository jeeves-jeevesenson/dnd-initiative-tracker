    description: You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection
      between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within
      60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance
      to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of
      damage. The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target
      become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again
      on either of the connected creatures.
