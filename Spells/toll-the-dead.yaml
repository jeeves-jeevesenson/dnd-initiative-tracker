    description: You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single
      chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 Necrotic damage. If the target
      is missing any of its Hit Points it instead takes 1d12 Necrotic damage. Cantrip
      Upgrade . The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 (2d8 or 2d12),
      11 (3d8 or 3d12), and 17 (4d8 or 4d12).
