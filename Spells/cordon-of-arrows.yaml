      the ground in your space. Until the spell ends, the ammunition can't be physically
      uprooted, and whenever a creature other than you enters a space within 30 feet
      of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece
      of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity
      saving throw or take 2d4 Piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed.
      The spell ends when none of the ammunition remains planted in the ground. When
      you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell
      ignores them. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The amount of ammunition that
      can be affected increases by two for each spell slot level above 2.
