    description: Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within
      range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into Difficult
      Terrain. They disappear when the spell ends. Each creature (other than you)
      in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw
      or have the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A Restrained creature
      can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
      DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer
      Restrained by them.
