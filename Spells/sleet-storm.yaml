    description: Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius
      Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured,
      and exposed flames in the area are doused. Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult
      Terrain. When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the
      Prone condition and lose Concentration.
