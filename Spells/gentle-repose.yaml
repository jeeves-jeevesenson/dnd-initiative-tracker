    description: You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target
      is protected from decay and can't become Undead. The spell also effectively
      extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent
      under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells
      such as Raise Dead .
