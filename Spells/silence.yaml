    description: For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through
      a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature
      or object entirely inside the Sphere has Immunity to Thunder damage, and creatures
      have the Deafened condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes
      a Verbal component is impossible there.
