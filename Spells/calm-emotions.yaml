    description: "Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you\
      \ choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected\
      \ by one of the following effects (choose for each creature): \u2022 The creature\
      \ has Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions until the spell ends.\
      \ If the creature was already Charmed or Frightened, those conditions are suppressed\
      \ for the duration. \u2022 The creature becomes Indifferent about creatures\
      \ of your choice that it's Hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target\
      \ takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the\
      \ creature's attitude returns to normal."
