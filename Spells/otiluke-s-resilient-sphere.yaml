    description: A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object
      within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
      or be enclosed for the duration. Nothing-not physical objects, energy, or other
      spell effects can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in
      the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature
      or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside,
      nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. The sphere
      is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside.
      An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and
      thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe
      can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A Disintegrate spell targeting
      the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.
