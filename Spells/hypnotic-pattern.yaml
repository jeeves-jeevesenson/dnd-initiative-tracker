    description: You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot Cube within
      range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area
      who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed
      condition for the duration. While Charmed, the creature has the Incapacitated
      condition and a Speed of 0. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes
      any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its
      stupor.
