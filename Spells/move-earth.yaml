    description: Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within
      range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose
      for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill
      in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such
      changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you
      affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or
      lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep,
      and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain's
      transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped
      or injured by the ground's movement. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend
      concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within
      range. This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks
      and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the
      terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this
      spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants
      along with it.
