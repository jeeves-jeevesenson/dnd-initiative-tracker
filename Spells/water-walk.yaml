    description: "This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface\u2014\
      such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava\u2014as if it were harmless\
      \ solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the\
      \ heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range gain this ability\
      \ for the duration. An affected target must take a Bonus Action to pass from\
      \ the liquid's surface into the liquid itself and vice versa, but if the target\
      \ falls into the liquid, the target passes through the surface into the liquid\
      \ below."
