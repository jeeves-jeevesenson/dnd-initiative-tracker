    description: A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range
      and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a
      20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 8d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start burning.
      Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell
      slot level above 3.
