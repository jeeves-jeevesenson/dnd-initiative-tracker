    description: One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Prone and Incapacitated conditions
      for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable
      of laughter, and it can't end the Prone condition on it self. At the end of
      each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving
      throw. The target has Advantage on the save if the save is triggered by damage.
      On a successful save, the spell ends. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . You
      can target one additional creature for each spell slot level about 1.
