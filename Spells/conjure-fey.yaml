    description: You conjure a Medium spirit from the Feywild in an unoccupied space
      you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like
      a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee
      spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes
      Psychic damage equal to 3d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the
      target has the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn, with
      both you and the spirit as the source of the fear. As a Bonus Action on your
      later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see
      within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within
      5 feet of it. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d12
      for each spell slot level above 6*.
