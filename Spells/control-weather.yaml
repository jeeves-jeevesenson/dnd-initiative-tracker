      \ You must be outdoors to cast this spell, and it ends early if you go indoors.\
      \ When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which\
      \ are determined by the DM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind.\
      \ It takes 1d4 \xD7 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they\
      \ do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather\
      \ gradually returns to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find\
      \ a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up\
      \ or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction. Precipitation\
      \ Stage Condition 1 Clear 2 Light clouds 3 Overcast or ground fog 4 Rain, hail,\
