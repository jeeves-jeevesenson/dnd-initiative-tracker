# Spells automation todo (level 0-5 only)

Current scope for this pass: **only spells level 0 through 5**.
Duplicates from intake lists were intentionally ignored.

## Automated in this pass
- Existing full-automation spells from the intake list were retained as-is.
- Added structured mechanics blocks (targeting + sequence + scaling/notes where available) to all remaining listed level 0-5 spells that previously had empty mechanics.
- Utility and persistent-effect spells now include explicit targeting and automation notes instead of empty mechanics placeholders.

## Complex spells to review
> This section is the **manual-review queue for the maintainer** (not for agents).  
> These spells now have baseline automation metadata, but still need deeper follow-up for multi-mode, persistent, summon, or highly contextual rules.
