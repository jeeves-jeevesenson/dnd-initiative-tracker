    description: Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the
      spell ends, the target's Speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class,
      it has Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action
      on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the Attack (one attack
      only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Utilize action. When the spell ends, the target
      is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave
      of lethargy washes over it.
