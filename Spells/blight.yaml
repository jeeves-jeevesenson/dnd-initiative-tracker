    description: A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving
      throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
      a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save. Alternatively,
      target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It
      doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies. Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
