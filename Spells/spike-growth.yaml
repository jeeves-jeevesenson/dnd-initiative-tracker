    description: The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within
      range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for
      the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing
      damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged
      to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast
      must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check
      against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering
      it.
