    description: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
      that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including
      sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't
      deal damage or cause conditions. If you are within range of the illusion, you
      can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within
      range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its
      movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image
      of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
      walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different
      times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction
      with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it.
      A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that
      it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
      your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the
      creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint
      to the creature. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The spell lasts until dispelled,
      without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.
