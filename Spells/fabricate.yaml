    description: "You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For\
      \ example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from\
      \ a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool. Choose raw materials that you\
      \ can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained\
      \ within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient\
      \ quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral\
      \ substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained\
      \ within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the\
      \ quality of the raw materials. Creatures and magic items can't be created by\
      \ this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree\
      \ of skill\u2014such as weapons and armor\u2014unless you have proficiency with\
      \ the type of Artisan's Tools used to craft such objects."
