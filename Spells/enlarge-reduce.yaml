    description: "For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an\
      \ object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted\
      \ object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature,\
      \ it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has\
      \ no effect. Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes\
      \ size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon\
      \ or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or\
      \ misses a target. Enlarge . The target's size increases by one category\u2014\
      from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has Advantage on Strength\
      \ checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged\
      \ weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit. Reduce . The\
      \ target's size decreases by one category\u2014from Medium to Small, for example.\
      \ The target also has Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\
      \ The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4\
      \ less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1)."
