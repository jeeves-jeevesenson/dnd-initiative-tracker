    description: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
      within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't
      accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. As a Magic action, you
      can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location,
      you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
      For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter
      the image so that it appears to be walking. Physical interaction with the image
      reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that
      takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
      with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
      DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
      through the image.
