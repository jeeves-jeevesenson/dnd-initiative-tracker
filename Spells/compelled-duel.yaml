    description: You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can
      see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has
      Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't
      willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you. The spell
      ends if you make an attack roll against a creature other than the target, if
      you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages
      the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
