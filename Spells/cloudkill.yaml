    description: You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on
      a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such
      as the one created by Gust of Wind ) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area
      is Heavily Obscured. Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving
      throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
      successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into
      its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes
      this save only once per turn. The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the
      start of each of your turns. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage increases
      by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
