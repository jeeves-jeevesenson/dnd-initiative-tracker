    description: For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot Emanation. While
      in the aura, creatures of your choice have Advantage on all saving throws, and
      other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them. In addition,
      when a Fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack roll,
      the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded
      condition until the end of its next turn.
