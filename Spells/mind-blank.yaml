    description: "Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity\
      \ to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected\
      \ by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts,\
      \ or magically detect its location, and no spell\u2014not even Wish \u2014can\
      \ gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind."
