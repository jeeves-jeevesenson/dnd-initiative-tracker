    description: You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation
      for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you
      can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its
      turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature
      takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. In addition, you can take
      the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spell's duration. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4*.
