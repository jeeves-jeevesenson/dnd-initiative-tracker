    description: For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any language
      that you hear or see signed. You also understand any written language that you
      see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It
      takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. This spell doesn't decode symbols
      or secret messages.
