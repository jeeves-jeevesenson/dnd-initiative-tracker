    description: Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until
      the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting
      position so it's impossible to track which image is real. Each time a creature
      hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each
      of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of
      the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates
      otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three
      duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the
      Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.
