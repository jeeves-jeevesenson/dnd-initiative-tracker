    description: You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and conjure similar
      spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) that launch forward
      and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 60-foot
      Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 Force damage on a failed save
      or half as much damage on a successful one. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
      . The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
