    description: You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, where it
      overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the
      duration. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or
      down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can perceive the plane
      you left, which looks gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet
      away. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can affect and be affected only by creatures,
      objects, and effects on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane
      can't perceive or interact with you unless a feature gives them the ability
      to do so. When the spell ends, you return to the plane you left in the spot
      that corresponds to your space in the Border Ethereal. If you appear in an occupied
      space, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage
      equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. This spell ends instantly if
      you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border
      it, such as one of the Outer Planes. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . You can
      target up to three willing creatures (including yourself) for each spell slot
      level above 7. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the
      spell.
