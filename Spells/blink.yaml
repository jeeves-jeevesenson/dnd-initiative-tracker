    description: "Roll 1d6 at the end of each of your turns for the duration. On a\
      \ roll of 4\u20136, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear\
      \ in the Ethereal Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that\
      \ plane). While on the Ethereal Plane, you can perceive the plane you left,\
      \ which is cast in shades of gray, but you can't see anything there more than\
      \ 60 feet away. You can affect and be affected only by other creatures on the\
      \ Ethereal Plane, and creatures on the other plane can't perceive you unless\
      \ they have a special ability that lets them perceive things on the Ethereal\
      \ Plane. You return to the other plane at the start of your next turn and when\
      \ the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane. You return to an unoccupied\
      \ space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you left.\
      \ If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest\
      \ unoccupied space."
