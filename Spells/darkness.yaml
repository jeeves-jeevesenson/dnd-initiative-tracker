    description: For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range
      and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can't see through it, and nonmagical
      light can't illuminate it. Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that
      isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation
      originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such
      as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness. If any of this spell's area overlaps
      with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower,
      that other spell is dispelled.
