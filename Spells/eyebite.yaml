    description: For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of
      your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom
      saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for
      the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a Magic
      action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has
      succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell. Asleep . The target has
      the Unconscious condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another
      creature takes an action to shake it awake. Panicked . The target has the Frightened
      condition. On each of its turns, the Frightened target must take the Dash action
      and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target
      moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can't see you, this
      effect ends. Sickened . The target has the Poisoned condition.
