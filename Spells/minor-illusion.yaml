    description: "You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts\
      \ for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The\
      \ illusion ends if you cast this spell again. If a creature takes a Study action\
      \ to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion\
      \ with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save\
      \ DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes\
      \ faint to the creature. Sound . If you create a sound, its volume can range\
      \ from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a\
      \ lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound\
      \ continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds\
      \ at different times before the spell ends. Image . If you create an image of\
      \ an object\u2014such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest\u2014it\
      \ must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can't create sound, light,\
      \ smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals\
      \ it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it."
