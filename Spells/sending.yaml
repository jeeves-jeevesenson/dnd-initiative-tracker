  raw:
    description: You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to a creature you have
      met or a creature described to you by someone who has met it. The target hears
      the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can
      answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables targets to understand
      the meaning of your message. You can send the message across any distance and
      even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane
      than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. You know
      if the delivery fails. Upon receiving your message, a creature can block your
      ability to reach it again with this spell for 8 hours. If you try to send another
      message during that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the spell fails.
