      have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can end the spell early by
      using either of the following special functions. Break Enchantment . As a Magic
      action, you touch a creature that is possessed by or has the Charmed or Frightened
      condition from one or more creatures of the types above. The target is no longer
      possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such creatures. Dismissal . As a Magic
      action, you target one creature you can see within 5 feet of you that has one

      or be sent back to its home plane if it isn't there already. If they aren't
      on their home plane, Undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and Fey are sent to
      the Feywild.
