    description: Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point
      you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is
      Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain. When the swarm appears, each creature
      in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed
      save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this
      save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its
      turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
