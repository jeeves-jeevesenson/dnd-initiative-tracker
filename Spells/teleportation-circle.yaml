    description: "As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground\
      \ inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation\
      \ circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same\
      \ plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you\
      \ drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters\
      \ the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in\
      \ the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Many major temples,\
      \ guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles.\
      \ Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence\u2014a string of runes arranged\
      \ in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell,\
      \ you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane,\
      \ determined by the DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your\
      \ adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it\
      \ for 1 minute. You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this\
      \ spell in the same location every day for 365 days."
