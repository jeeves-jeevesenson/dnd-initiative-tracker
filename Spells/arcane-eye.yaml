    description: You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers
      for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which
      can see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.
      As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid
      barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as
      small as 1 inch in diameter.
