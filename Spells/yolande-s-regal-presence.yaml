    description: You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot Emanation.
      Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever
      a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can
      force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target
      takes 4d6 Psychic damage and has the Prone condition, and you can push it up
      to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage
      only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
