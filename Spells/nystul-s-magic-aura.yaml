    description: With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object
      that isn't being worn or carried. A creature gains the Mask effect below, and
      an object gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts for the duration.
      If you cast the spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the illusion
      lasts until dispelled. Mask (Creature) . Choose a creature type other than the
      target's actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if
      it were a creature of the chosen type. False Aura (Object) . You change the
      way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect magical auras,
      such as Detect Magic . You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, make
      a magic item appear nonmagical, or change the object's aura so that it appears
      to belong to a school of magic you choose.
