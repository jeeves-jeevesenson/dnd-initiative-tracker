    description: You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal Plane. You
      must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serve as Material components
      for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material
      (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane,
      you can take a Magic action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears
      in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the
      chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic action to touch the chest
      and the replica. After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance at the
      end of each day that the spell ends. The spell also ends if you cast this spell
      again or if the Tiny replica chest is destroyed. If the spell ends and the larger
      chest is on the Ethereal Plane, the chest remains there for you or someone else
      to find.
