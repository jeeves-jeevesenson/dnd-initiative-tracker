    description: You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of
      stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like.
      For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or coffer,
      or you could make a small passage through a wall that is 5 feet thick. You could
      also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create
      can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
