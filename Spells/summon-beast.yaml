    description: 'You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
      that you can see within range and uses the Bestial Spirit stat block. When you
      cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles
      an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines
      certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to
      O Hit Points or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your
      allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its
      turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required
      by you). If you don''t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement
      to avoid danger. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Use the spell slot''s level
      for the spell''s level in the stat block.'
