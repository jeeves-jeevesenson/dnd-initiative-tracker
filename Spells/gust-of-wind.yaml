    description: A Line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you
      in a direction you choose for the duration. Each creature in the Line must succeed
      on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction
      following the Line. A creature that ends its turn in the Line must make the
      same save. Any creature in the Line must spend 2 feet of movement for every
      1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor,
      and it extinguishes candles and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes
      protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent
      chance to extinguish them. As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can change
      the direction in which the Line blasts from you.

  - Failed save: target is pushed 15 feet along the line; saving throws repeat if ending its turn in the line.
  - Moving toward the caster costs extra movement; wind disperses gas and extinguishes flames.
