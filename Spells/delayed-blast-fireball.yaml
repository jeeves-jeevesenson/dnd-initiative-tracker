    description: A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen
      point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends,
      the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on
      that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal
      to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
      successful one. The spell's base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by
      1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended. If a creature touches
      the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving
      throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful
      save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters
      a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the
      bead explodes. When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that
      aren't being worn or carried start burning. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
      . The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.
