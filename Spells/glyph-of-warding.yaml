    description: You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe
      it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an
      object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The
      glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or
      object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph
      is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly imperceptible
      and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save
      DC to notice. When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether
      it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below. Set the Trigger
      . You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
      on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing
      another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it.
      For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that
      object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You
      can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for
      example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions
      for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain
      password. Explosive Rune . When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy
      in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area
      makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning,
      or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or
      half as much damage on a successful one. Spell Glyph . You can store a prepared
      spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the
      glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored
      has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered,
      the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature
      that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered
      on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful
      objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack
      it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full
      duration. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . The damage of an explosive rune
      increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph,
      you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for
      the Glyph of Warding .

  - Explosive rune damage type is chosen when created (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder); adjust as needed.
  - Spell glyphs store another spell (single-target or area) that triggers from the glyph.
