    description: You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius
      Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that
      enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there
      makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate
      lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this
      save. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions
      to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive
      yet must be truthful.

  - Saves occur when a creature first enters or starts its turn in the area; the effect persists for the spell's duration while inside.
