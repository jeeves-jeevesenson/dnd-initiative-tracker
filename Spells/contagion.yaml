    description: Your touch inflicts a magical contagion. The target must succeed
      on a Constitution saving throw or take 11d8 Necrotic damage and have the Poisoned
      condition. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. While Poisoned,
      the target has Disadvantage on saving throws made with the chosen ability. The
      target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until it
      gets three successes or failures. If the target succeeds on three of these saves,
      the spell ends on the target. If the target fails three of the saves, the spell
      lasts for 7 days on it. Whenever the Poisoned target receives an effect that
      would end the Poisoned condition, the target must succeed on a Constitution
      saving throw, or the Poisoned condition doesn't end on it.
