    description: "You make yourself\u2014including your clothing, armor, weapons,\
      \ and other belongings on your person\u2014look different until the spell ends.\
      \ You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You\
      \ must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have.\
      \ Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by\
      \ this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use\
      \ this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and\
      \ anyone who touches it would feel nothing. To discern that you are disguised,\
      \ a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed\
      \ on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC."
