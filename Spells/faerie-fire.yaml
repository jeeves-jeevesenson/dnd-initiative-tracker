    description: Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green,
      or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if
      it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures
      shed Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the Invisible condition.
      Attack rolls against an affected creature or object have Advantage if the attacker
      can see it.
