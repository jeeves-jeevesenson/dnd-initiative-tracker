    description: "You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot\
      \ Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be\
      \ affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target's Speed is halved,\
      \ it takes a \u22122 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't\
      \ take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action,\
      \ not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If\
      \ it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the\
      \ spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.\
      \ An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending\
      \ the spell on itself on a success."
