    description: You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results
      of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The
      DM chooses the omen from the Omens table. Omen For Results That Will Be... Weal
      Good Woe Bad Weal and woe Good and bad Indifference Neither good nor bad The
      spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change
      the results. If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest,
      there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that
      you get no answer.
