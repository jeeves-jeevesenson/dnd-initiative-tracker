    description: 'Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid
      within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose
      bones or a Zombie if you chose a corpse. On each of your turns, you can take
      a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if
      the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
      can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
      You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its
      next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or
      corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and
      moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow
      it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
      after which it stops obeying any command you''ve given it. To maintain control
      of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
      again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts
      your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather
      than animating a new creature. Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . You animate
      or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot
      level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile
      of bones.'
