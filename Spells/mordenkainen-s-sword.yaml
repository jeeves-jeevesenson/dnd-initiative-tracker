    description: You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for
      the duration. When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against
      a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage
      equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On your later turns,
      you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can
      see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.
