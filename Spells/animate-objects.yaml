    description: Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects
      within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and
      aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting
      ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one
      object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three. Each
      target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated
      Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends
      or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell
      is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count
      and takes its turn immediately after yours. Until the spell ends, you can take
      a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if
      the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
      can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).
      If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only
      to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object
      form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller),
      1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.
