    description: One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a
      discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
      failed save, it takes 3d6 Psychic damage and must immediately use its Reaction,
      if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route.
      On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot . The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
