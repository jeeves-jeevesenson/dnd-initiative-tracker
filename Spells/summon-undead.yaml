    description: 'You call forth an Undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
      that you can see within range and uses the Undead Spirit stat block. When you
      cast the spell, choose the creature''s form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The
      spirit resembles an Undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain
      details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points
      or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat,
      the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
      after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you
      don''t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
      Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot . Use the spell slot''s level for the spell''s
      level in the stat block.'
