    description: You teleport to a location within range. You arrive at exactly the
      spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you
      can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward"
      or "300 feet upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle." You can also teleport
      one willing creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport,
      and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space. If you,
      the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or
      completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with
      you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.
