    description: "Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a\
      \ casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell\u2014\
      called the contingent spell\u2014as part of casting Contingency , expending\
      \ spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead,\
      \ it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when\
      \ you cast the two spells. For example, a Contingency cast with Water Breathing\
      \ might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed\
      \ in water or a similar liquid. The contingent spell takes effect immediately\
      \ after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to,\
      \ and then Contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you,\
      \ even if it can normally target others. You can use only one Contingency spell\
      \ at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another Contingency\
      \ spell on you ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material component\
      \ is ever not on your person."
