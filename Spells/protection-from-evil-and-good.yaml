    description: Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
      against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends,
      or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types
      have Disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't
      be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened conditions from them. If the
      target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the
      target has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
