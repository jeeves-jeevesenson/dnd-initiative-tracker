    description: You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature
      of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes
      a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage
      and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target
      takes half as much damage only. A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage.
      On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
