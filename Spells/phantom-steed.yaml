    description: A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in
      an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance,
      and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created
      by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet
      away from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride
      the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block, except it has a Speed
      of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed
      gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early
      if the steed takes any damage.
