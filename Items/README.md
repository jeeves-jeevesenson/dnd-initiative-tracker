# Items YAML Data

Item definitions are split by type to support structured automation:

- `Items/Weapons/` — weapon YAML files
- `Items/Armor/` — armor YAML files

Use stable ids and machine-readable fields so UI/automation can reliably consume item data.

For weapons, this repo currently includes:
- `catalog_2024_basic.yaml` for core weapon entries
- `properties_2024_basic.yaml` for shared property definitions
